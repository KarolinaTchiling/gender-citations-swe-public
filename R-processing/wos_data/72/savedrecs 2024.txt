AB With the popularity of social software such as Facebook and Twitter, online text data has begun to explode. However, due to the sparseness and imbalance of text data, it is difficult to accurately analyze and process data such as emotions contained in online text. Therefore, according to the characteristics of Web text, the Web text data extraction model based on biterm topic model, bidirectional recurrent neural network, topic embedding and attention mechanism, namely BTM-BRNN-TEAM model, is proposed to improve the accuracy of emotion analysis in short text. The test results show that when the first 10 topic words are selected, the recognition accuracy, error rate, precision, recall rate and F1-measure of this model are about 77.6%, 22.4%, 83.4%, 76.4%, and 0.82, respectively, which are higher than those of the other two models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model is about 0.91, which indicates that its performance is superior. In the processing of short text sentences, the proposed model is able to accurately identify aspectual words that have a significant impact on the text, while weakening the impact of non-aspectual words. The above results show that the Web text processing model proposed in this study has superior performance in sentiment analysis and semantic recognition.

AB Technical solutions for evaluating traditional English teaching composition and other problems, such as excessive subjectivity, waste of time, slow feedback, short scoring time, heavy tasks and so on. This paper first analyzes the theoretical basis of neural network algorithm, and completes the preprocessing of the composition text submitted by students from three aspects: text segmentation, text representation and text fragment retrieval. Then, an intelligent evaluation system of English composition is established, and the scoring standard of English composition is determined. On this basis, the design of English scoring module is improved, and an anti cheating module for common plagiarism problems in English composition is added. Finally, the English composition intelligent evaluation system is tested. It can effectively complete the target task, evaluate and correct the composition, and has a higher recognition success rate and accuracy rate. By studying the algorithm and applying it to the construction of English composition intelligent evaluation system, this paper successfully designs a kind of English composition intelligent evaluation system, which promotes the development of teaching work.

AB In terms of control strategies for social entertainment robots, advanced control system design was adopted in the study, aiming to enable robots to achieve efficient collaborative art performances. The control system is based on machine learning algorithms and Internet of Things technology, combined with the application of sensing technology, providing accurate environmental perception and real-time feedback mechanisms for robots. Considering the collaboration and interaction between robots and human actors, control strategies adapted to different scenes were designed by analyzing and understanding the needs of artistic performances. These strategies not only consider the robot's own actions and performance, but also the interaction with human actors and the coordination with the entire performance scene. The control method in this article combines machine learning algorithms and sensing technology to enable robots to make intelligent decisions and action planning by learning and perceiving real-time environmental information. By modeling and simulating the structure and characteristics of the robot, precise planning and control of the robot's motion trajectory can be achieved. Through dynamic modeling, it is possible to better understand the motion characteristics and energy consumption of robots, and to adjust and optimize their actions during the performance process.

AB E-learning is an interactive online learning mode that can enhance students' interest in learning in an entertainment environment. This article aims to develop an English vocabulary learning recommendation system based on decision tree algorithm and naive Bayesian algorithm to provide personalized learning suggestions and help learners learn and remember words more effectively. Firstly, a large amount of English vocabulary data was collected, preprocessed, and feature extracted. Decision tree algorithms were selected as the foundation, and through analysis of existing data, a decision tree was generated to classify new data. Using learners' characteristics (such as age, learning objectives, etc.) and learning history (such as learned words, learning time, etc.) as inputs, a personalized recommendation model was constructed, This model can recommend suitable learning content for learners based on their personalized needs and learning situation. In order to better understand learners' learning progress, a naive Bayesian model was trained using learners' learning history and progress information to analyze their current learning progress and predict their future learning situation. Through testing and evaluation of actual learners, the recommendation system performs well in providing personalized learning suggestions, and has a significant improvement effect on learners' vocabulary learning.

AB With the assistance of digital media, entertainment oriented E-learning models can effectively enhance students' learning enthusiasm. This article analyzes the application of entertainment E-learning mode based on Apriori algorithm in intelligent English reading assistance mode. At present, English reading teaching faces some problems, such as outdated teaching methods, passive learning among students, excessive emphasis on imparting grammar knowledge while neglecting the improvement of students' reading skills and strategies, and so on. Therefore, this article conducts research on intelligent English reading comprehension tools based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm. This paper proposes a recreational E-learning model based on Apriori algorithm. Based on Apriori algorithm, students' interests and preferences on different learning resources and entertainment elements are mined and incorporated into the learning model design. Then, a set of entertaining English reading assistant model is designed, which uses a variety of entertainment elements, such as gamified learning, interactive activities and reward mechanism, to increase students' learning participation and enthusiasm. This article adopts the idea of LSA algorithm to construct a BERT semantic analysis model. We treat nodes in the network as word items and then use singular value decomposition algorithm to decompose the word document matrix. Secondly, the original association rule Apriori algorithm was optimized, and the optimized association rule Apriori algorithm effectively solved the problem of excessive computation in traditional algorithms. Finally, based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm, this article designs an intelligent English reading comprehension tool, mainly analyzing the practical application of the system and greatly improving the efficiency of English reading teaching.

AB Affective computing researchers have been studying emotion recognition (ER) based on real-world facial photos and videos for a while now, and it's a very popular area. With the sounds produced by head posture, facial deformation, and lighting fluctuation, ER is still difficult to execute in the wild. This research employs a machine learning model for sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) in entertainment computing to perform emotion decoding for movie picture categorization. Emotion labels are produced for every video sample by the suggested model, which takes video data as input. First, we employ a face identification and selection process based on the video data to identify the most consequential face areas. Here, facial expressions from films have been gathered as input pictures, which have then been processed for noise reduction and normalisation. Then, in order to analyse the facial expressions in this image, it was segmented using the fuzzy K-means equalisation clustering model. Convolutional adversarial U-net graph neural networks have been used to classify the studied pictures for emotion decoding. Several movie-based emotion datasets are subjected to experimental analysis in order to determine accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, RMSE, and AUC. With excellent classification accuracy, the suggested deep learning paradigm shows promise in identifying the emotional shifts in gamers. The suggested method achieved 97% accuracy, 96% precision, 92% recall, 85% F-1 score, 79% RMSE, and 86% AUC.

AB The objective of this research is to provide methods for recognizing diverse piano song styles for online piano learning game design. The aim is to enhance the innovation and practicality of teaching games. To achieve this, a piano song style recognition model based on deep learning and convolutional cyclic hashing methods has been designed. The model effectively recognized different styles of piano music by transforming music data into acoustic spectrograms and analyzing them using a hybrid deep learning network. The experimental results indicated that the model performed well in several performance metrics and outperformed traditional methods. Specifically, when the feature maps was 24*5, the model achieved the highest values of MAP, Precision@500, and HAM2 metrics, which were 79%, 79.4%, and 79.8%, respectively. This study demonstrates that online piano learning games can offer a wide range of stylistic practice songs, which can enhance learners' musical experience and improve their learning outcomes.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the role of social robots in sports activities has gradually become prominent. Robots can help with intelligent control of sports venues, assist in motion guidance, and engage in emotional communication with users, helping athletes adjust their emotions. This article studies the motion training posture monitoring of entertainment robots based on the interaction between the Internet of Things and VR. A new high-intensity motion attitude monitoring system based on quantum dot photodetectors has been developed to improve monitoring accuracy and stability. Entertainment robots can simulate and analyze motion training postures, and provide relevant technical guidance. The quantum dot photodetectors were integrated into the sensor components, and the collected data was transmitted to the data acquisition and processing unit through signal transmission and processing modules. The collected data was processed and analyzed to achieve real-time monitoring and tracking of the target object's attitude. Multiple experiments were conducted on the entire system, simulating various high-intensity exercise environments, and evaluating the performance parameters of the system. Through continuous optimization and improvement, the stability and accuracy of the system were ultimately ensured.

AB A firm's raw data is collected, integrated, analysed, and presented using a variety of technologies and applications that make up business intelligence (BI). By contrasting historical and current performances, these systems assist in formulating plans and decision-making for improved outcomes in the future. Furthermore, it assists organisations in detecting the business issues and industry trends that require attention. The modern corporation is almost entirely dependent on artificial intelligence (AI), which speeds up communication in many ways and simplifies operations. Several of the jobs that were formerly completed by workers and employees are now completed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems, software, or software apps loaded on them. This study uses machine learning and a decision-making system to assess smart business network management and control management. Here, resource allocation is based on decision-making, and control management is performed utilising a multiagent markov probabilistic reinforcement model to manage the business network. Based on business management, network resource allocation, and control management, the experimental study is conducted with respect to accuracy, packet delivery ratio, routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment (RMSA). Businesses may choose the finest technology for automated business process management (BPM) with the help of the machine learning and artificial intelligence approach to process optimisation and management.

AB Using gamification and video games is one of the modern approaches to cognitive enhancement and improving the abilities and competencies of managers, including strategic thinking skills. Many organizations use video games in the fields of education, marketing, business, and entrepreneurship. This research aimed to investigate the role of video games in enhancing managers' strategic thinking and their potential contribution to developing cognitive capabilities. The sample included 30 students actively involved in the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. To measure the strategic thinking of the participants, Pisapia's strategic thinking questionnaire was used, and the CANTAB test was employed to measure their cognitive capabilities. To identify the individuals' game -playing styles, indicators of micro -management, planning, plan recognition, predictions, gathering resources, partial observability, and damage avoidance were designed. The findings indicated that 53.3 percent of the participants had reflective thinking, 30 percent had systems thinking, and the rest had a reframing thinking style as their strategic thinking dominant dimension. On the other hand, given the identified correlation between the damage avoidance criteria with the thinking and reflective style, as well as the inverse and significant correlation of the gathering resources criteria with the results of the PRM test, it seems that strategic games have the potential to change and even develop some cognitive functions such as attention, reaction, and memory, and can be considered as tools to improve cognitive ability. These games can be used to design tasks to enhance managers' cognitive abilities and subsequently promote their strategic thinking and decision -making skills.

AB In the current digital entertainment environment, the art learning mode of human-computer interaction can effectively enhance students' interest. Entertainment robots, as a novel personalized interaction tool, can provide a more intelligent and entertaining way for art teaching. This article analyzes the personalized recommendation of entertainment robots in art education based on human-computer interaction and data mining.On the basis of collecting a large number of fine art education resources and organizing and labeling them, data mining technology is used to extract user background information and interest preferences. Information retrieval technology is used to filter out content related to user interests from the massive art education resources based on the extracted user interests. We also use recommendation algorithms to sort and personalize the recommended content based on the user's historical behavior and other user evaluations, in order to improve the accuracy of recommendation results and user satisfaction. The effectiveness and practicality of this personalized recommendation model were verified through user surveys and data analysis. The experimental results indicate that this model can quickly and accurately recommend suitable fine art education content for users, improving their learning effectiveness and experience.

AB The goal of this article is to provide a novel and creative performance experience by developing a music structure and beat recognition model, designing a social entertainment robot music performance system, and achieving collaborative music performance between robots and humans. Research on using edge detection algorithms to partition music structures and determine the beat and rhythm changes of music. Using machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify music beats to adapt to different music styles and rhythms. By utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dance segments that conform to musical beats and rhythms were generated and combined with musical performances. In order to ensure the accuracy and smoothness of music performance, various sensors were integrated to monitor the robot's posture and motion status in real-time. After experimental verification, by integrating technologies such as music recognition, dance generation, and sensor data control, collaborative performance between robots and humans can be achieved. Research has shown that close collaboration between robots and performers can be achieved, resulting in collaborative performance. This not only improves the quality and effectiveness of music performance, but also increases entertainment and interactivity, bringing users a richer and more interesting music entertainment experience.

AB Developed a 3D indoor virtual scene assembly system based on dual touch screen. The system adopts a combination of 2D views and 3D views. The 2D and 3D views are displayed on the two touch screens. We have comprehensively designed various interactive operations of 2D view and 3D view from the perspectives of simplicity, easy learning and easy to use, and reduced the complex 3D interactive operations to 2D interactive operations. Users can conduct two-dimensional interactive operation and 3D interactive operation based on two display screens, which can realize the efficient assembly of 3D virtual scene. The results indicate significant differences in the number of modifications of mode A and B (t = 2.982, p = 0.006 < 0.01), effective design time (t = 4.990, p < 0.001), first design satisfaction (t = 5.074, p = <0.001) and final design satisfaction (t = 2.787, p = 0.010 < 0.05). Participants in mode A had fewer modifications and shorter effective design times compared to mode B. Study and design a new workbench supporting the collaborative design of 3D virtual scenes. The workbench can support a three-dimensional indoor virtual scene assembly system based on dual touch screen, and designers and users can assemble the virtual scene together. The workbench mainly consists of two touch displays and a holographic display device. The holographic display device displays the three-dimensional scene designed by the user in real time, and supports the designer and the user to operate the three-dimensional scene through the touch film attached to it. Touch display enables designers and users to assemble scenes on 2D views through simple touch operations such as drag and drop. The face-to-face collaborative design method provided by the workbench is more conducive to the communication between designers and users, so as to improve the design efficiency of 3D scenes.

AB Along with the process of building China's modern vocational education system, China's higher vocational education has made great progress. With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability.

ID CARLO TREE-SEARCH; MODEL
AB Go plays a very prominent role in quality education and mental health education. Go can cultivate character, make friends, improve interpersonal relationships, and promote mental health. To apply it to mental health and emotional regulation, the AlphaGo series algorithms are analyzed. To address the unstable deep reinforcement learning training, low training data utilization, model sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and heavy parameter tuning burden, the algorithm is optimized by combining ensemble learning and advanced deep reinforcement learning. Then, the weighted voting method is applied to the selection step of sub nodes in the Monte Carlo tree search process. At the same time, asynchronous parallelization improvements are implemented to improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Finally, a board game based on ensemble learning and improved Monte Carlo tree search algorithm is obtained. Through experimental analysis, the average winning rate of the system was 93.36 %. The number of users who were very satisfied with the game was 83.96 %. After intervention, the depression and anxiety scores of the experimental group students were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The designed game can effectively alleviate user anxiety and depression, providing new ideas for the psychotherapy.

AB Researchers frequently state that game controllers, affect the Player Experience (PX). We also conducted this study to examine the effects of controllers on PX dimensions, including industrial design features that are missing in the field. In our study with 34 participants, we implemented four directionally mapped controllers using a PC game. We also used controller-specific experience questions in our study, using Player Experience Inventory (PXI) and Core Elements of the Gaming Experience (CEGE) models. In addition, we conducted a comparative analysis of all data using AttrakDiff2 to evaluate the designs of the products. Implications of the results regarding controllers' design features are discussed regarding PX. The participants' experience level and familiarity with the device were effective in evaluating their experience. A correlation was observed between the controller's enjoyment and the game's enjoyment. There is also a relationship between enjoyment and the hedonic qualities of the controllers. The features of the controllers, such as ease of use and challenge are related to PX dimensions.

ID GRAPH
AB Procedural content generation is a field that focuses on creating game assets employing algorithmic procedures. A critical asset in many game genres is the map. Due to the sophistication of the game map development, procedural map generation has been the subject of many studies. Considering the fundamental complexity of the game maps, many of these studies try to engage human designers in the generation process to improve the output of algorithmic procedures. However, these studies have not paid adequate attention to important nonfunctional requirements such as generality, comprehensiveness, controllability, and adaptability to iterative development. This paper presents a procedural map generation framework that places map designers at the center of a pipeline architecture. This framework allows designers to configure different pipeline modules and specify the characteristics of their desired map. Moreover, this framework has assertion checking features that facilitate map evaluation. We demonstrate the capabilities of this framework through one running example, along with three case studies that generate maps for first -person shooter, real-time strategy, and dungeon crawler games. Furthermore, we present a user study to show the suitability of this framework in iterative development processes and demonstrate how it reduces the labor of human designers.

AB Increasing technology advancements have led to a number of problems with modern corporate decision-making, which is a challenging occurrence in the absence of business intelligence and machine learning (ML). Because effective decision-making is impossible without ML, integration of ML with business intelligence (BI) is essential to both corporate decision-making and business intelligence as a whole. Only once they have learned anything again may machines assist in your educational process. This study suggests a fresh approach to knowledge building in company management decision-making through the use of gaming and machine learning models. Using a game model that involves decision-making, knowledge analysis based on business management is conducted. Subsequently, quantum reinforcement reward neural networks build knowledge. The accuracy, precision, recall, F_1 score, MSE, NSE of business management modelling with knowledge growth are all assessed by simulation. The student's gender had no bearing on the income they were offered throughout the job placement process or their MBA specialisations in Marketing and Finance (Mkt & Fin) or Marketing and Human Resource (Mkt & HR), according to a statistical t-test with a significance threshold of 0.05 (p > 0.05).

AB This study designs an entertainment interactive robot system for gaming psychotherapy intervention and evaluates its effectiveness in preventing depression in students. In terms of the architecture and hardware of the entertainment interactive robot system, the robot adopts high-performance processors and sensors to achieve the ability to quickly respond and accurately perceive user actions. In terms of software, a mathematical model was established based on the structure and kinematic principles of the robot to describe its motion. Preprocess user gesture data by analyzing the features and patterns of user gestures, extracting key action information, and using machine learning algorithms or deep learning models to classify and recognize gestures to determine user intent and action types. Evaluate action recognition and effectiveness, and verify the accuracy and reliability of the gesture interaction module through comparison and testing with actual user gestures. The study designed an entertainment interactive robot assisted game that provides a fun and interactive experience to attract students ' attention and stimulate positive emotions. Through game design and behavioral pattern evaluation, the research team evaluated the preventive effect of entertainment interactive robot assisted games on depression and proposed optimization strategies.

   Vocabulary Acquisition
AB The fundamental component of language learning is the lexicon. Among various ways employed to facilitate vocabulary development, playing video games can highly contribute to developing vocabulary incidentally. This study examines how playing digital games impacts EFL learners' incidental vocabulary acquisition. It also investigates gender in digital equity using a digital game, i.e., Minecraft. A total of 73 male and female Iranian pupils between the ages of 9 and 14 were recruited to examine whether incidental vocabulary acquisition through gameplay was effective and to determine whether gender could affect the results. As such, the two-way ANCOVA was run through SPSS to analyze the data. The results indicated that the gamers performed far better than the memorization group. However, no interaction effect between gender and the dependent variable was observed. The implications of the findings can benefit educators and young learners to choose appropriate digital games as supplementary tools for L2 lexical acquisition. The findings contribute to the increasing research on digital games' potential as an effective tool for promoting vocabulary development.

AB The use of participatory design (PD) to inform the design of games and learning technology seems to be appropriate for marginalized groups of people, including children with autism. However, specific traits of the autism phenotype can create a barrier in facilitating participation of autistic children during PD activities, especially when their verbal abilities are limited. Involving parents in PD projects can help address challenges related to the communication abilities of the children. We have facilitated the design augmented reality (AR) games by including four autistic children and 9 parents. We analyzed qualitative data using an inductive approach using affinity diagrams and thematic analysis. We present insights from the parents on the use of AR technology and how it can be incorporated at home to enhance word learning activities. We report on (1) a set of five games based on learning by repetition, learning by classification and learning by association; (2) novel insights and knowledge about learning strategies and (3) tools to support autistic children in learning new words. We conclude our study by discussing the relevance of involving parents of autistic children in PD activities, offering design implications.

AB This article is based on facial recognition and further designs an entertainment electronic learning mode. Facial emotion recognition may be affected by light, angle, and expression. In order to improve recognition accuracy and stability, distortion adjustment techniques were used to process facial images, ensuring that the model can accurately capture and recognize the features of facial expressions. The study applies online facial emotion recognition to entertainment electronic learning modes, where learners interact with the system. The system can detect and recognize learners' facial expressions in real-time, and provide corresponding feedback and learning resources based on different expressions. By collecting and analyzing experimental data, evaluate the practicality of the model and the level of acceptance and satisfaction of learners towards the model. The entertainment electronic learning mode based on facial recognition provides an innovative learning approach by constructing a pattern architecture, distortion adjustment, and applying online facial emotion recognition. By optimizing the positioning and integrating the entertainment electronic learning mode with environmental art and design courses, we aim to enhance students' learning motivation and interest. Develop optimization strategies to enhance students' comprehensive abilities in the field of environmental art and design.

AB This article proposes a gesture robot music interaction system based on wireless sensor networks, aiming to achieve a user experience of music perception interaction with robots through gestures. The system adopts sensing technology, obtains user gesture information through sensors, converts it into instructions, and controls the actions of gesture robots. The study elucidated the framework of a music interaction system and designed an overall music interaction system framework. Users interact with the system through gestures, and the system obtains user gesture information through sensors and converts it into corresponding robot action instructions. In this way, users can control the robot's actions through gestures and achieve music perception interaction with the robot. The optical flow algorithm can infer the motion trajectory and velocity changes of gestures by analyzing the displacement information of pixels between consecutive frames, capture the dynamic characteristics of user gestures, and achieve more precise control and response to robot actions, enhancing the music interaction experience between users and robots. Based on the experimental results, we found that the system can accurately recognize the user's gesture input and quickly convert it into corresponding music interaction instructions. The response time of the system is also within an acceptable range, which can meet the real-time feedback needs of users. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system.

AB With the development of multimedia technology, interactive entertainment experience is an important feature of online teaching mode. Students can engage in interactive learning through various mobile apps and online tools. E-learning provides an innovative way of learning that enables distance learning through electronic course simulation. The objective of this research is to design and develop an improved E-learning course simulation for law teaching by applying hybrid data clustering algorithms and enhancing interactive experiences to improve student engagement and learning outcomes. This article analyzes the simulation of legal education E-learning electronic courses based on mixed data clustering algorithms and interactive experiences. On the basis of the mixed data clustering model of the k-means algorithm, we propose a probability based mixed clustering model that can effectively handle the clustering problem of mixed data. Based on this algorithm, we have established a legal teaching network system platform based on artificial intelligence. The hybrid data clustering algorithm solves the instability problem of the k-means algorithm in the construction of the legal teaching network course platform, providing a reliable solution for the development of artificial intelligence network courses. Based on teaching concepts and combined with various technological characteristics such as network technology and multimedia technology in the information age, users who pass through this teaching system can fully utilize the teaching resources and various functions in the system. The hybrid data clustering algorithm proposed in this article has good clustering performance.

AB Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) has garnered significant interest in game research fields for many years. Despite high expectations, the effectiveness of DDA in enhancing player experiences has yielded mixed results. This paper aims to rethink the theoretical foundations of DDA by addressing four crucial questions about the issues, definition, scope, value, and design of DDA. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to provide novel insights into DDA and DDA design. We revealed DDA's unhealthy reliance on Flow theory, redefined DDA based on the concept of game difficulty, and discussed DDA's scope and value. Additionally, we presented a goal-based DDA design framework and proposed a 6 -step DDA design process as a practical approach. This work offers theoretical support for understanding and designing DDA in future game research.

AB Using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with user experience, engagement, and attitude toward a website, this study aims to draw on recent theoretical insights for the impact of regulatory fit derived for prevention-focused (promotion-focused) users faced with a more utilitarian (hedonic) website on their intentions to use the website and recycle resources. This study employed survey data from 472 Taiwanese with internet experience. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the developed model and hypotheses. This study shows that intention to use the website has a significantly positive effect on the practice of recycling resources. Further, social influence, facilitating conditions, and user attitude toward the website are key determinants of intention to use the website and recycle resources. This analysis also identifies the mediating effects of user experience, performance expectation, effort expectation, and engagement on the association of regulatory fit with intention to use the website and recycle resources. This study extends and validates the role played by promotion- and prevention-focused users encountering a hedonic versus utilitarian website (i.e., generation of regulatory fit) in enhancing user experience, engagement, performance expectation, and effort expectation, and in turn, intensifying behavioral intentions. In addition, it confirms the mediating effects of such experience, engagement, and expectation in an online gamification context.

AB Social media platforms have changed the way of communication. They are making the world more connected and provide information more quickly, which has resulted in beneficial and harmful effects on society. Analyzing data from multiple social media platforms to spot patterns and trends in user behavior in response to environmental changes is part of using social networking evidence to investigate the effects of environmental variables. The infinite collection of personal data generates privacy issues and ethical questions about data security and utilization.We present a novel framework called meta-heuristic atom search optimized dynamic artificial neural network (MASO-DANN) method for examining the impact of environmental factors using social networking evidence and the complementary abilities between MASO as well as DANN. The study aims to determine the connections between the dynamics of users' social relationships and involvement by examining the data from various online social platforms. We collected a Twitter dataset and preprocessed the data using the stop word removal preprocessing method.With the use of MASO-DANN, extensive social networking data analysis has been rendered achievable, which offers an exhaustive overview of the complex dynamics influencing online communities. The result findings examined various metrics, such as accuracy (95.07%), precision (89%), recall (88%), F1-score (90%) and RMSE (1.6).These metrics demonstrate the robustness along with the dependability of MASO-DANN and its capacity to provide more accurate predictions that evaluate the effects of environmental factors based on social networking evidence.

AB Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to the numbers that are located in its headers. In this study, we analyze different techniques to solve this type of logical problem using an Heuristic Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Heuristic Algorithm with Neural Network. Furthermore, we generate a public dataset to train the neural networks. We published this dataset and the code of the algorithms. Combination of the heuristic algorithm with a neural network obtained the best results. From state of the art review, no previous works used neural network to solve nonograms, nor combined a network with other algorithms to accelerate the resolution process.

ID NEEDS
AB Music therapy provides a good environment for the teaching of children with special needs, to study the application effect of game aids combined with listening music therapy on the teaching of children with special needs. Firstly, the hardware and content of the game accessories for music therapy are designed, and then the binaural difference frequency algorithm and adaptive filtering algorithm are improved. To enhance the binaural frequency difference and reduce computational complexity, the variable step size algorithm of the tongue line function incorporates the average absolute error. Additionally, the introduction of relevant vectors improves the signal-to-noise ratio for microphone or linear input signals within the variable step size algorithm of the tongue function. The results showed that the improved variable step size adaptive filtering algorithm of tongue function had better convergence and better steady-state error. Compared with the control group without real-time binaural differential frequency processing music, the relative power theta% of EEG in the experimental group was significantly reduced, and the sensory-motor rhythm% and beta% were significantly increased after EEG-induced music therapy, and the beta theta reduction reached an extremely significant level, only alpha% of the difference was not significant. The parents' behavior problems, learning problems, impulsivity/hyperactivity, and hyperactivity index were significantly reduced. The integration of listening and music therapy with game aids is beneficial for the teaching of special needs children and brings beneficial effects.

AB In the field of social robot teaching, research has focused on how to use technological means to provide better learning support and personalized interactive experiences. Social robots can interact with students and provide personalized learning support, thereby improving their learning effectiveness and engagement. The speech sensing model of social robots can perceive students' emotions and feedback in real-time through technologies such as speech recognition and sentiment analysis, thereby providing intelligent responses and guidance. The deep learning recommendation model for music course resources extracts music features through deep learning techniques, and combines session interest extraction techniques to personalized recommend music resources suitable for students' interests and abilities. By analyzing students' interests and learning goals, robots can provide music learning resources that meet their needs based on recommendation algorithms, further stimulating their learning interest and enthusiasm. The experimental results show that the use of social robots in the learning environment significantly improves the learning effectiveness and participation of students. Through personalized interaction and intelligent response guidance, students are more likely to understand and master music knowledge, while experiencing joyful and positive learning emotions. The study validated the effectiveness of social robot assisted music courses based on speech sensing and deep learning algorithms, demonstrating its advantages in improving student learning effectiveness and engagement.

AB Artificial intelligence robots based on machine vision have shown great potential in dance action recognition and interaction. In order to perform action recognition, a large amount of dance action video data was collected as the basis for training and testing the model. In motion recognition, various computer vision techniques are used to extract motion features from images or videos to capture key information of dance movements. Machine learning technology was adopted to construct an action classification model. By using the data collected in the early stage and the extracted features, an efficient and accurate classifier has been studied and trained. It can classify the input dance actions into different categories, segment continuous video frames into different action segments, and ensure accurate differentiation of different dance actions during the recognition process, avoiding misjudgment or confusion. By accurately capturing and analyzing the posture information of the human body, we can better understand and simulate dance movements, and enhance the performance and realism of artificial intelligence robots in dance interactions. The experimental results show that the system can accurately recognize various dance movements and achieve good interaction with users.

AB Gallifantes and motivation' is a teaching innovation project intended to foster students to participate in the university online campus of UNIR, a fully online university. Although students at UNIR are used to studying in an online independent way, it is well known that having a learning community and a confident-based relationship with mates enhance learning results. Intended to promote a lively interaction between students, both in the forums and in synchronous lessons, this teaching innovation project proposes gallifantes-rewarded actions during the semester in a competitive run. The 4 students with the highest numbers of gallifantes obtain 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 additional points in the final grade. In this paper, we present the different approaches followed in 3 subjects in the areas of technology and design, having a total number of 114 active students and 1164 gallifantes rewarded. The students answered a survey at the end of the process.

AB Virtual robot and immersive VR experiences provide consumers with new ways of perception in the design process of decorative material environments. This experiential process is virtual, intuitive, and entertaining, and is widely recognized by consumers.The purpose of this study is to improve the processing effect of virtual images of decorative materials by image denoising algorithm. In this paper, the image acquisition and modeling technology based on sensor network and image denoising algorithm are used to process the acquired image data, and the processed image is applied to the virtual system of decorative materials. Through the application of image denoising algorithm, the noise in the image is reduced, and the clarity and authenticity of the virtual image of decorative materials are improved. This makes it possible to select the best decoration scheme more accurately when comprehensive calculation is carried out from various aspects such as aesthetic and functional data, and provides a new feasibility and method for environmental design and decoration material selection. The research results demonstrate that the system can achieve virtual image processing in environmental decoration scene design, thereby improving the level of indoor environmental art design.

AB This study takes mini-detail short videos on Taobao as the research object to explore whether perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness moderate the relationship between mini-detail short videos and purchase intention. Mini-detail short videos can be conceptualized as multimedia effects, virtual experiences, and product personalized recommendations. Therefore, the discussion of mini-detail short videos and consumer purchase intention is transformed into the discussion of multimedia effects, virtual experience, product personalized recommendation and consumer purchase intention. In this study, a research model based on TAM2 is proposed. A total of 168 valid questionnaires were collected using the questionnaire method. AMOS structural equation model23.0 and spss23.0 were used to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire data. The results show that perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness partially mediate the relationship between multimedia effect, virtual experience, personalized product recommendation and consumers purchase intention. Obviously, multimedia effects, virtual experience and personalized product recommendations are the main factors that affect consumers shopping intentions. Notably, this study found that perceived playfulness was more important than perceived usefulness in influencing customers purchase intention. Based on these findings, the conclusions of this thesis will enable Tao bao merchants and platform managers to identify the mechanism of the impact of mini-detail short videos on consumer purchase intention.

AB E-learning, as a part of social networking services, can effectively improve the effectiveness of teaching. At the same time, in the process of knowledge dissemination, digital entertainment models can also enhance students ' interest in learning. This article analyzes the effectiveness of interactive E-Learning mode based on artificial intelligence in English learning research. The semantics of English are relatively rich, and the same meaning can be expressed using different words or expressions. By calculating the similarity of sentences, students can understand the connections and differences between different expressions. Students can master the diversity and flexibility of word meanings by comparing different sentences, thereby improving their vocabulary and expression ability. By combining word vectors with semantic similarity, we can better measure the similarity between sentences, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of natural language processing. We validated the effectiveness and feasibility of our model by demonstrating its ability to distinguish polysemy and its performance on word similarity datasets in experiments.

AB The present study aimed to test the reasons behind people's use of Pokemon Go during the Covid-19 pandemic (post-lockdown) in Romania, along with a set of particular factors that could contribute to the enhancement of users' mental health (i.e., loneliness, social intimacy, social intelligence, and social capital). To do this, we investigated several correlations between the key variables and models for predicting the level of loneliness and the strength of "bonding" and "bridging" links, based on reasons for playing Pokemon Go. The research was conducted on a sample of 238 individuals (47 % males and 53 % females; M = 26.38, SD = 6.70). Our findings have revealed that the game itself became a coping mechanism during the challenging Covid-19 situation, facilitating and initating gatherings in small groups to uphold the social component of mental health. Furthermore, our findings contribute to the scientific knowledge by illustrating how an augmented reality -based game can positively impact mental health in crisis situations, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on the results, we discuss theoretical and practical implications of Poke<acute accent>mon Go on mental health, emphasizing the aspects that mental health workers and game developers need to consider for improving the mental health of the users.

AB This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to portray an overview of pedagogical strategies that Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) teachers adopt to support children's play with coding toys. In addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers' views in relation to the use of coding toys in ECEC and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as children's development after play activities with coding toys. The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer -reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children's development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. As an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers.

AB Previous studies show few women in Computing in educational institutions and industry. There is a need to create approaches to increase women's interest in the field and reverse the current situation. This article reports the construction and evaluation of a digital game directed at women that may increase their interest in Computing. From the evaluation, it was possible to identify a set of recommendations for games that may contribute to meeting the objective and the audience under study. This study was based on the Action Design Research methodology, in which research includes methods for constructing and evaluating an artifact, which in this case is a game focused on women. We collected preliminary requirements through an online questionnaire, which received responses from 32 women. Afterward, the game under development went through three evaluation stages: in each, we conducted semi-structured interviews. In total, we conducted 31 interviews. We transcribed and analyzed the interview responses using Content Analysis and Quantitative Text Analysis. Among the 13 recommendations identified and verified, 11 are new. We organized them into four main categories: Design, Gameplay, Motivation for women, and Representativeness. These recommendations can assist the game industry in developing digital games that may stimulate women's interest in Computing.

TI Prov-DIFF: Play traces analysis through provenance differences

AB A game session comprises a series of user decisions, inputs, and the execution of a strategy to reach specific goals. Tracking generated data of a game session is important for game analytics for developers and players. Game session data can be used for reproducibility, analysis of game traces, understanding player behavior, and improving the outcome in future sessions by learning from mistakes. However, game telemetry can rapidly lead to large amounts of data that can overwhelm the analyst's ability to analyze it, and it can be difficult to identify the reasons that might have caused a player to lose in that session. This paper proposes a provenance-based automatic debugging approach for game analytics. It identifies possible reasons and discrepancies that might have led a player to lose by contrasting their performance with other players. Our approach also proposes possible insights on how to improve the player's performance to reach the goal. We integrated our solution into the existing provenance visualization tool Prov Viewer. We provided an experimental study to demonstrate that our approach can identify probable causes that led the player to lose and propose changes to make it work in the next execution.

AB To protect the decorative culture of ethnic minorities in northeast China, a method of intelligent extraction of decorative patterns is proposed. Based on Relative Total Variation and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering algorithms, GrabCut image segmentation algorithm is improved to extract the contours of decorative patterns, density peak clustering algorithm is improved, and color clustering algorithm is constructed. This paper proves that the algorithm has fast convergence speed and strong convergence performance. For different types of complex, simple, painting, complex background and interior decoration images, GrabCut algorithm extracted pattern contour pixel accuracy values of 95.55 %, 96.77 %, 95.21 %, 98.50 % and 99.5 %, respectively. The algorithm performed best when extracting interior decoration images with simple background. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was 96.2 %, 96 %, 94 % and 98 % for extracting the main color of red, green, yellow and black, and the accuracy of black was the highest. Compared to other methods, the proposed method had higher accuracy in extracting the outline and color of decorative patterns, and the extraction effect was excellent. It allows more complete extraction of decorative patterns. This method was beneficial in safeguarding the cultural heritage of minority ethnic groups in northeast China and facilitating the analysis and study of the cultural characteristics of northeast China.

DE Reinforcement learning agent; Dynamic difficulty adjustment and;
   single-player action video games
AB Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) within video games aims to avoid frustration or boredom. This paper provides the first framework for designing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent with DDA for single -player action video games. The framework includes the definitions of states, actions, and rewards. We propose a 2Q -table system that can provide a better winning/losing ratio and extend the duration of the rounds. We apply the framework to a use case study. We address the challenges that the design and implementation of RL agents with DDA for single -player action video games might present, such as (i) large and/or continuous action-state spaces, (ii) an appropriate definition of the rewards for achieving a correct DDA, (iii) learning from each player online from limited samples and (iv) in an arcade shooter video game. The two evaluations performed (with computer -driven and human players) show that the paper's goals are met since players face personalized challenges according to their playing skills.

AB This paper aims to explore the application of virtual reality (VR) electronic learning based on load balancing algorithm in the simulation of intelligent music education system. This paper designs and implements an intelligent music education system simulation, which uses load balancing algorithm and virtual reality (VR) technology to provide the convenience of e-learning and personalized learning experience. The load balancing algorithm allocates and manages multiple tasks or requests in the system to ensure the balanced utilization of resources and the efficient operation of the system. In the intelligent music education system, the load balancing algorithm can be used to manage user requests, allocate appropriate resources and services, and ensure that the system can respond quickly and provide a stable learning environment. This paper introduces the architecture and implementation details of the system, including the design and optimization of load balancing algorithm and the application of VR technology. The results show that we point out that VR e-learning based on load balancing algorithm has potential in the simulation of intelligent music education system, which can provide high-quality personalized music learning experience and provide useful enlightenment for innovation in the field of music education.

AB Maintaining health and preventing chronic diseases requires awareness of the energy and nutrient content of one's diet. Due to the rapid development of computing and Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, nutritional evaluation can be performed using smartphones or wearable food images.Thechallenges of this technology include estimating the visual estimation of the amount of food in a bowl. We describe an innovative approach for determining a bowl's dimensions by sticking a paper ruler throughout the bottom and edges yet photographing the outcome. We used a variety of colored liquids, bowls and crystallized foods to evaluate the precision of our technique for measuring food volume employing spherical bowls as boxes. Different food-related datasets can have other numbers of images, types of food dining bowls and estimated food capacity from the images represented. Image preprocessing using a wiener filter enhances the estimating of food dining bowl capacity from images. Following preprocessing, a threshold-based approach to image segmentation is used for the resulting data; finally, we used the Gradient Lion Swarm Optimized Discrete Recurrent Neural Network (GLSO-DRNN) model to present an AI-based multi-dish food identification approach. An excellent mAP = 0.96 was found between the results. The suggested model shows great promise as a means of improving dish reporting because of its high classification performance.The GLSO-DRNN performed better to proving its flexibility and efficient discrete parameter optimization. In addition to offering accurate food quantity estimates, it demonstrated significant potential for other uses in the field of smart dining technology. The results highlight an effective of this advanced computational method that is improving food dining bowls and interactions with components associated with food. In the future, we plan to improve the techniques' performance and incorporate our technology into a working Smartphone based on the cloud environment.

AB The ageing of the population has brought about a huge demand for healthy elderly care. Various companies and enterprises have launched many healthy elderly care products to service the elderly. It is reported that the field of elderly care is still in the development stage in China. Service management issues have gradually emerged with the increasing number of healthcare services and business complexity. However, there is a lack of a platform with an overall description model for unified management of health and elderly care services on the market. This paper proposed the HUAM (Healthcare Unified Access Model) to solve the access complexity of multi-language and multi-platform healthcare services, which standardised unified access to health and elderly care services. For service and product resources and function attributes, the proposed model was a unified description and behavioural norms for health care service. Moreover, the HUAConsole (Healthcare Unified Access Console) was developed to solve the problem of accessing healthcare services, which depended on the HUAM model. It was obtained that compared with before accessing the developed platform, the number of lines of code after access was reduced by 15 % on average, which had reasonable data and performance with some non-business functions. In addition, this paper highlights a service circuit breaking + inspection algorithm, a custom addressing algorithm, a service function aggregation scheme, and a reasonable architecture design, which efficiently overcomes technical problems and difficulties.

AB In the digital era, online reactions to broadcast media are an important feature of audience engagement. Although central, the question of the temporality of audience online reactions has been understudied. We investigate this question by exploring the temporal patterns of online reactions to fictional characters' deaths. More than 3,500 forum reactions to Game of Thrones characters' deaths were collected over 5 years. Temporal patterns of reactions to expected deaths displayed more long-term patterns, while reactions to unexpected deaths displayed more spontaneous patterns. These results further our understanding of death reactions' temporality in cyberspace, in a multimedia and transmedia storytelling context.

AB Virtual robots, as an intelligent technology, can provide efficient and accurate green landscape design solutions. This study explores the application of virtual robots in green landscape design based on digital images and machine learning techniques. The research and design of a green landscape environment mapping model enables virtual robots to accurately describe green areas. By using advanced sensor technology, virtual robots can perceive key nodes in the environment and construct an accurate map of green areas. Panoramic image synthesis technology utilizes image sensors carried by virtual robots to obtain multiple images in the environment, and concatenates them to generate panoramic images. Through panoramic images, virtual robots can obtain a broader field of view, and improve the accuracy and authenticity of green landscape design. By applying image dehazing algorithms, the impact of fog is effectively reduced, and the clarity and authenticity of the image are improved, enabling designers to better observe and evaluate the greening effect. By perceiving the environment, establishing green area maps, using panoramic images, and applying machine learning processing techniques, virtual robots can accurately perceive the situation of green areas and provide high -quality data and visualization effects for green design.

ID SENSOR
AB College student entrepreneurship teams can leverage the advantages of mobile internet resource integration and online collaborative production platforms to easily integrate various resources, thereby achieving rapid start-up and development of entrepreneurial projects. This also makes the threshold for college students to start businesses lower and easier to achieve. This article designs an interactive aesthetic education and entrepreneurship teaching system based on multimodal feature fusion and interactive systems. The core concept of the interactive aesthetic education and entrepreneurship teaching system is multimodal feature fusion and interactive system. Multimodal feature fusion can integrate different teaching resources, so that students can better understand the factors that need to be considered in the entrepreneurial process and practice. Interactive systems can enable closer interaction and communication between students and teachers, thereby better understanding and mastering entrepreneurial knowledge and skills. The design and implementation of a systematic system will help enhance the entrepreneurial ability and quality of college students, help them better understand the entrepreneurial process and factors that need to be considered in practice, and provide entrepreneurial practice reference for students in Chinese universities who have the intention of designing entrepreneurship.

AB This study investigates how automated adaptable learning (BSG) may improve business simulating games (BSG) and its transformation possibilities. The rapid increase of information, combined with the intricate nature of today's company contexts, means that classic BSG education techniques frequently fail to adequately prepare students for the difficulties they will face in everyday life. This study provides a revolutionary architecture that continually evolves learning paths, responses, and testing situations based on specific student progress and desires. It does this by utilizing modern artificial intelligence methods, including machine learning. This technique seeks to maximize users' preservation of expertise, ability to make decisions, and capacity for creative thinking through tailoring their education. In summary, our study raises possibilities for better and more interesting educational opportunities throughout the modern age by adding to the continuing conversation about the relationship between AI, training, and corporate strategies.

AB The development of technology has intensified people's interest in virtual reality technology. Virtual reality technology is also widely used in fields such as teaching and healthcare. To improve the real-time and operability of virtual reality interaction systems, a motion capture and virtual reality interaction system design for online experimental teaching is proposed. The active apparent model is used for facial feature point localization, and the joint capture method is improved by combining threshold segmentation and forward kinematics algorithms. Experimental data confirms that compared to Kinect method, the improved hand joint detection method has higher joint positioning accuracy, with a loss rate of less than 40 % for hand joints. The average judgment accuracy of the six facial expression tests is 82 %, 81 %, 79 %, 78 %, 80 %, and 81 %, respectively. The comprehensive recognition accuracy of facial expression recognition is 80.17 %. The read, write, and update times for each frame of the virtual reality interaction system are 102.6 ms and 427 ms, respectively. The system memory usage is 920.5 M, and the CPU and GPU usage rates are 25.2 % and 4.4 %, respectively. The system can run smoothly. The virtual reality system can run continuously for 24 h, with strong operability and low difficulty in expanding system functions, achieving design goals.

AB E-learning provides a flexible way of learning, which can provide corresponding learning content and tasks according to students' interests, abilities and learning progress, so that students can choose learning content and learning progress more independently. In traditional teaching methods, teachers need to spend a lot of time and energy to evaluate students' learning. The e-learning system can automatically record students' learning behavior and learning results, and give feedback and evaluation in time during the learning process. Automatic speech recognition systems have been widely applied in various fields, and the demand for more user-friendly and convenient user operating systems is becoming increasingly urgent. This article proposes an English automatic speech recognition system based on hidden Markov model algorithm and conditional random field algorithm to improve recognition accuracy and stability, and applies it to the computer field. Label inference and optimization for speech recognition were carried out using the conditional random field algorithm. By establishing the correlation between features and labels, label inference was performed on the speech signal, which was compared with existing speech recognition systems to evaluate whether the recognition accuracy and stability of the new system had been improved. The results show that the English automatic speech recognition system based on hidden Markov model algorithm and conditional random field algorithm exhibits high performance in terms of recognition accuracy and stability. Compared with traditional speech recognition systems, this system has made significant improvements in the application of computer science.

AB With the advent of the smart age, all industries are undergoing revolutionary changes, and more reliable, faster, and unmanned data analysis and mining have become a prominent feature of today's industry. With basketball as an iconic sport, better data processing models will drive sports games to be played more efficiently. As an essential sport in China, basketball has more than 100 years of history. With the leap development of basketball, data analysis technology has also been widely used. The data seen in basketball games is a set of systematic data formed by professional workers through division of labor and close cooperation, classification and aggregation, and statistical analysis. In addition, based on the information on the court, spectators get a general idea of how the players perform in the Game and predict where the data will go. This article explores the significance and application of basketball game data analysis methods and shows that the analysis of basketball game data can effectively promote the development of basketball.

AB Despite having great potential, microtransactions are an understudied business model in the video game industry. The current study explores the buying process of microtransactions to highlight the most important factors affecting such behavior. Using pre-validated scales, a questionnaire was administered online to 301 participants who were asked to evaluate their impulse buying tendency (IBT) and purchase intention (PI) for microtransactions within gaming scenarios. The study found a positive relationship between drivers, such as performance, hedonic content and social factors, flow experience, and impulse buying. This tendency leads to a higher intention to purchase microtransactions. Businesses can utilize the paper's findings to tailor their microtransaction content to these drivers, leading to higher profits.

AB Online educational games are easy to be affected by hardware and network status and have delay problems, which will affect students' learning interest and enthusiasm. Therefore, in this study, Bayesian optimization method is used to optimize the parameters of the "gradient boosting + category features" algorithm, and an improved "gradient boosting + categorical features" ensemble algorithm is designed using the integration framework of RF. And based on this, an online education game acceleration model is designed. The experimental results showed that the improved "gradient boosting + categorical features" algorithm, which combines Bayesian optimization and RF integration framework, was superior to the partially improved and traditional "gradient boosting + categorical features" algorithm in online education game recognition. The former's Accuracy mean and Precision mean in various online education games were 98.9 % and 99.3 %, respectively. Compared with other common ensemble algorithms and deep learning algorithms, the research outcomes expressed that the Accuracy of the algorithm designed in this study in the training phase and the F1 value in the testing phase were 98.6 % and 99.0 %. respectively, which were significantly higher than other intelligent algorithms. The test results of the game acceleration model constructed based on this algorithm and other comparative algorithms indicated that the online education game acceleration model constructed based on the improved "gradient boosting + categorical features" algorithm could minimize the delay phenomenon generated during game operation to the greatest extent. The model designed in this study has the potential to solve the problems of running lag and delay in online education games, which is beneficial for improving students' user experience and learning absorption effect in such game applications.

AB This article proposes a new social robot system that achieves robot dance creation through dance image feature extraction and dance action imitation, thereby promoting the development of digital media dance entertainment culture. This paper uses the edge computing model, and on the basis of the robot's own computing power, puts some computing tasks related to image processing and action imitation down to the edge of the network to improve the real-time and fluency of dance performance. The study utilized image feature extraction technology to analyze and process dance images, achieving the imitation of dance movements by robots. By imitating and innovating dance movements through robots, unique forms and content can be provided for digital media dance performances. Digital media technology provides rich means and forms of expression, which can make robot dance performances more creative and artistic.

AB Avatars are often a key component of many videogames, and users can frequently develop relationships with these virtual characters that can impact their gameplay behaviour. The purpose of the present study was to explore the Proteus effect (PE) and the impact that avatar gender can have on an individual's gameplay experience in Fallout: New Vegas, a videogame environment that has not been present in any previous PE research. A total of 353 participants were recruited using an online survey measuring three previously unexplored gameplay behaviours, comprising (i) number of quests completed, (ii) number of locations discovered, and (iii) number of non-player characters (NPCs) or enemies killed. The results of the present study indicated that players controlling an avatar of the same gender to their physical selves demonstrated a significantly greater performance across the variables of quest completion and location discovery than players controlling an avatar of a different gender. Furthermore, a newly identified potential PE consequence was found in terms of the number of NPCs or enemies killed, with players controlling a female avatar achieving a significantly higher score on this measure irrespective of the physical world gender of the user.

AB Development of recommender systems has recently emerged as a prominent study field that has drawn the attention of several scientists and researchers worldwide. Various fields, such as music, movies, books, news, search queries, and commercial goods, employ recommender systems. One of the well -liked and effective RS strategies is the collaborative filtering algorithm, which seeks out users who are quite similar to active one to propose products. This study suggests a unique method for recommending films based on analysis of user preference data that combines ALS collaborative filtering with deep learning techniques. The input in this case is gathered as web data based on previously performed user searches and then processed for noise reduction and normalisation. Convolutional multimodal auto multilayer graph with ALS collaborative filtering (CMAMG_ALSCF) was used to classify this processed data according to user evaluations and interests. Movies that are related to the interests of users are recommended by examining the similarity between users and other users or the similarity between movies and other movies. For several movie recommendation datasets, experimental analysis is done in terms of training accuracy, validation accuracy, RMSE, and average precision.

AB Nearly real-world experiences in a variety of industries may be had with virtual reality (VR) technology. Virtual reality (VR) settings are widely used, and as a result, a large quantity of data is being collected from them. The data-driven development paradigm must be advanced and analytical procedures must be created as the amount of data increases. There are several trends and possibilities that have emerged from integration of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as machine learning (ML) in business intelligence. Modern technology has completely changed how companies gather data, draw conclusions, decide. In order to analyse complex environments, this study uses gamification and virtual reality in business intelligence modelling for e-learning. Here, virtual realitybased e-learning is modelled for business intelligence, and gamification using reinforcement alexnet Q-kernel component neural networks is used to analyse the network's complexity. Prediction accuracy, AUC, average precision, sensitivity, quadratic normalised square error are metrics used in experimental study. The evaluation's findings demonstrate the usefulness of our solution for classifying and forecasting pay levels in the business sector, which in turn helps business analytics in intricate AI settings.

AB The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence has facilitated the development of multimedia teaching and learning in the field of education, as well as providing intelligent methods for gamified teaching methods in the field of basketball. Currently, research on recognizing basketball video behavior primarily focuses on group behavior recognition methods for key individuals. However, there is currently no group behavior recognition method that can effectively distinguish features that reflect different events for temporal interactive behaviors such as dunks and steals in videos, as well as situations where key players are obstructed. The paper suggests a group behavior identification algorithm for basketball game videos based on the hidden tag mining technique in order to perform intelligent analysis in the fields of supplemental training and tactical analysis of gamified instruction. And this algorithm is integrated with the fusion of individual features to create the basketball video's group behavior identification algorithm with hidden label mining approach. According to the study's findings, the distribution of motion pattern features is more agglomerated and regular when the merging threshold is 0.6 and the best hyperparameter is 3. After the study applied the crucial individual feature extraction module, the overall group behavior identification accuracy increased by 6.44 %. The group behavior recognition algorithm for basketball videos that incorporates individual features and hidden label mining techniques outperforms the most recent patio-temporal domain-based group behavior recognition algorithm by 15.56 % when compared to the accuracy of commonly used algorithms. In summary, the study proposes a basketball video group behavior recognition algorithm with better performance. This algorithm achieves group behavior recognition in basketball game videos, promotes auxiliary training for students in gamified teaching mode, and provides a practical and feasible approach for intelligent analysis of other sports events. It also provides technical support for coaches and referees.

AB Most popular and quick data creation applications on Internet are social media (SM), which makes studying these data more important. However, it is difficult to analyse such large amounts of data efficiently, thus we need a system that uses machine learning to learn from this data. Systems can learn on their own thanks to machine learning techniques. Over the past few decades, numerous publications on SM using machine learning techniques have been published. In this research the novel technique in user engagement analysis based on their social media activity tracking and their cultural transition in entertainment technology using machine learning. Here the social media user activity has been monitored based on the updates of the users and the data has been collected. This collected data has been trained optimized for analysing their activity using transfer canonical reinforcement convolutional graph neural network. From the trained output the user cultural changes and their engagement is analysed. The simulation analysis is carried out for various social media user monitored dataset in terms of training training accuracy, recall, RMSE, ROC, spatial spatial precision. Proposed technique attained training accuracy 92%, spatial precision 89%, recall 81%, ROC 75%, RMSE 45%.

AB With the rapid development of information technology, E -Learning has become an innovative teaching method. However, in the field of Chinese teaching, how to provide effective learning resources and recommendation algorithms in E -Learning mode is still a challenge. This study aims to improve the effectiveness of Chinese teaching system and students' learning outcomes through an immersive E -Learning model based on big data interest recommendation algorithm. This paper adopts an immersive E -Learning model based on big data interest recommendation algorithm, and constructs a Chinese teaching system. The web crawler is used to fully collect the experimental data and collate it in a targeted manner, and the required data is screened out by using a more efficient separation method. Adding big data recommendation algorithm to the system of this paper can not only record and analyze historical behaviors of users, but also recommend data information according to users' interests, so that users can clarify their real information needs. By testing the system's professional ability and recording the experimental data, this paper finds that the overall performance of this Chinese language teaching system is very good, and can achieve the original expected design purpose. In addition, the system largely solves the problem that the traditional system based on data recommendation algorithm is difficult to carry out effective recommendation smoothly when the total amount of data is too large.

AB With the vigorous development of information technology, the integration of multimedia technology with the field of education has sparked an undeniable wave. The E-learning teaching model has features such as entertainment, digitization, and real-time feedback. This article analyzes the simulation of E-learning virtual interaction based on video object tracking algorithm in Chinese language and literature multimedia teaching system. The research determined the educational objectives of the E-learning system, understood the needs and characteristics of learners, developed multimedia textbooks related to Chinese language and literature, organized the teaching content and decomposed it into appropriate units, created a user-friendly virtual E-learning platform, integrated virtual interactive functions, designed interactive learning activities. Provide social features between learners to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaborative learning. In order to effectively evaluate the functionality of the system, we have chosen to appropriately include the average peak function in the evaluation indicators, and have also compared it with traditional tracking algorithms. We have also better combined the advantages of video target tracking algorithms with the teaching of Chinese language and literature majors. On the basis of tracking algorithms, the plot and characters of literary works appear in the form of "motion", greatly increasing the vividness and fun of teaching. After experimental verification, the multimedia teaching system constructed based on video object tracking algorithms has shown great potential in the relevant teaching fields of this major. This research has brought unprecedented results to the education field, thereby promoting further innovation and reform in the Chinese language major.

AB The new intelligent technology represented by 5G and XR has become the core driving force of the fourth industrial revolution, and the integrated application of the two in the field of education is also promoting the continuous transformation of teaching to gamification. Based on XR + 5G fusion technology, this paper proposes the optimization design of a gamified education model. Firstly, the problem of how to improve the network performance through D2D communication in a full-load 5G network is studied, and a D2D communication resource allocation framework based on cross-layer optimization design is proposed. In D2D user access control, a D2D user access criterion based on the distance between the CU user and D2D user receiver is designed according to the QoS requirement, maximum transmit power limit, and user channel information. XR simulation platform was designed based on a 5G network with optimized communication resource allocation. UMa and InH simulation scenarios were set according to XR business model working scenarios, and Wrap Around algorithm was used to model two circles of interference for users, ensuring the reliability of results while improving simulation efficiency. Finally, the platform channel was modeled strictly according to the channel modeling method in technical document 38.901, and the channel was calibrated with the channel provided by 3GPP. Based on the simulation platform, gamified education design is optimized. Including class platform and class platform gamification design, system demand analysis, and database design. In the gamification design, a relatively novel classroom interaction mode is introduced to increase students' enthusiasm in class. In the demand analysis of the system, the main problems in class are listed, based on which the business and functional requirements of the gamification platform are determined. Experiments show that in the IID scenario, the proposed XR + 5G fusion technology can achieve 1.09 times the training speed and obtain 0.83 % learning accuracy gain compared with the individual learning algorithm. In the Non-IID scenario, the training speed of the proposed fusion technique is 1.03 times that of the individual learning algorithm, and there is a learning accuracy gain of 2.27 %.

AB Physical activity is one of the most important elements in the motor and cognitive development of school and high school students. As has been demonstrated in different studies, physical exercise improves students' intellectual performance while positively influencing their health. In this work an educational tool based on the Kinect sensorization system capable of interacting with students in a proactive and dynamic way has been designed. Through the use of a projector and a set of balls, students interact with various games and activities. The Kinect system detects the movement and position of the balls thrown by the students and generates a response to the game or activity performed. Thanks to the flexibility and ease of use of the designed tool, it is possible to easily develop new games or activities adapted to each subject. In this way, teachers are provided with a new didactic tool to promote the knowledge of a certain area through games and physical activity of the students. In order to validate the system, a case study has been carried out in a school with real students. The results obtained are very promising.

AB Business intelligence (BI) proves insufficient for managing the daily operations of any firm in today's data-rich environment, given the overwhelming volume of available data. This has led to the emergence of big data, where the sheer magnitude of information becomes challenging to analyze. Consequently, implementing a methodology for real-time decision-making, traditionally associated with BI, becomes time-consuming due to data overload. Real-time processing of both structured and unstructured data has become crucial for organizations to fortify themselves against man-made threats and natural disasters. As a result, relying solely on BI for accurate decisionmaking at the corporate level is increasingly challenging. This study proposes a novel approach to address business intelligence security and privacy analysis by leveraging a machine-learning-trained game model. Specifically, a fuzzy probabilistic Gaussian encoder neural network combined with a game theory model (FPGENN_GT) is employed to analyze business intelligence security and privacy. The experimental study involves various business intelligence security analysis datasets, assessing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, the method's ability to handle unstructured data, beyond the structured data commonly used in traditional BI, underscores its potential for processing diverse data types. The research aims to enhance the understanding of business intelligence security and privacy by introducing a machine learning-driven game model, contributing to more robust decision-making processes in the face of evolving data challenges.

   Value; Perceived Enjoyment; Stimulus -Organism -Response (SOR) framework
AB This study aims to present a theoretical model that would explain the factors influencing behavioural intention towards Extended Reality (XR) in gaming applications using Stimulus -Organism -Response (SOR) framework. The survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaire through social media platforms which garnered about 358 respondents as a part of purposive sampling. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used in analysing the data collected. The results confirm that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived risk, performance expectancy, attitude and perceived value are significant variables in investigating the behavioural intention towards XR in gaming applications. Apart from that, this paper has confirmed that technology anxiety has an insignificant effect in moderating the relationship between attitude and behavioural intention towards XR in gaming applications compared to past studies. The finding from this research would help gaming industry, esports community, and government policymakers to learn more about the factors affecting behavioural intention towards XR in gaming applications for the purpose of business, nation building and selfknowledge. This research contributes to the literature especially on factors affecting behavioural intention of people towards XR in gaming applications using the SOR framework.

AB The present study explored of mediating effect of Self-esteem (SE) on Purchase Intention (PI) and Problematic Online Gaming (POG) among school children. A carefully crafted survey instrument was used to collect data from 765 adolescents. After validating the variables and constructs, hypotheses were tested with Hayes (2018) PROCESS macros. The findings indicated that the relationship between POG on PI was positive and significant. This study also proved the existence of a positive and significant relationship between POG and SE. Also, it was found that there was a positive and significant association between SE and PI. This study has also proved the mediating effect of SE on POG and PI. We recommended that marketers design their online promotions by including more interactive dimensions. Also, we suggested that marketers consider the gamification of advertisements. This study has robust managerial and social implications as we also recommended appropriate parental control and de-addiction measures.

AB The level of teaching quality largely reflects the overall strength of universities and has a direct impact on the quality of cultivating high-quality talents. In this context, higher education institutions are constantly striving to explore innovative methods, but this diverse educational environment also brings challenges to the evaluation methods of teacher teaching quality. This article explores the application of video adaptive sampling in AI data analysis of university education evaluation based on soft computing technology. In order to solve the data sampling problem in university education evaluation, this paper proposes a video adaptive sampling method based on soft computing. In this paper, an E-learning virtual interactive system is designed, multimedia teaching materials matching the requirements of E-learning environment are created, tools suitable for E-learning virtual interactive environment are selected and integrated, soft computing technology is adopted, intelligent algorithms and data analysis methods are combined. By extracting and analyzing the key information in the video, the video sampling strategy is dynamically adjusted to realize the adaptive video sampling. Modeling the content characteristics of videos through fuzzy logic, and using genetic algorithms to optimize the sampling frequency and accuracy of videos. The experimental results indicate that the video adaptive sampling method based on soft computing can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of AI data analysis in university education evaluation. Compared with traditional fixed sampling methods, this method can dynamically adjust according to the characteristics of video content, reduce redundant data sampling, and improve the accuracy of data analysis.

AB With the development of intelligent voice and interactive robot technology, new technologies have built a virtual E-learning learning environment that can provide students with an immersive learning experience, making this new learning mode more entertaining. This article investigates the application of entertainment interactive robots based on speech recognition in English artificial intelligence teaching evaluation and automatic feedback. The system has constructed an oral evaluation model based on deep reinforcement learning, which learns the optimal behavioral strategies through interaction with the environment. The model will train through oral conversations with learners to learn how to accurately evaluate oral proficiency and provide relevant feedback. After the construction of the system is completed, the accuracy and efficiency of the system are improved by adjusting the parameters of the model, increasing the diversity of training data, and improving the user interface and interaction mode based on user feedback, making it more friendly and easy to use. The experimental results show that the English oral evaluation and automatic feedback system designed in this paper based on deep reinforcement learning and speech recognition algorithms has high accuracy and efficiency. The system can accurately evaluate learners' oral proficiency and provide personalized learning suggestions based on individual differences.

AB With the development of the Internet, E-learning has become an important way of education. However, in online English classes, user experience problems still exist, such as network delay and slow video loading speed, which affect the learning effect and user engagement. Therefore, this paper hopes to improve E-learning user experience by studying routing algorithm and data visualization analysis technology. The routing algorithm is used to optimize the network connection. By analyzing the network topology and data transmission path, the optimal route is selected to reduce the network delay and bandwidth consumption. Data visualization technology is used to analyze and display the behavior and learning data of learners in the classroom in real time, so as to help learners better understand their learning situation. The experimental results show that the application of routing algorithm and data visualization analysis technology can significantly improve the user experience of online English classes. The stability of learners' network connection in the classroom is improved, the video loading speed is accelerated, and the learning effect is also significantly improved. By optimizing network connectivity and providing real-time data analytics, it is possible to meet the individual needs of learners and improve their learning effectiveness and engagement.

AB The research and moral use of academic technology focuses on developing, implementing, and overseeing the use of suitable technical resources and procedures to enhance learning and achievement. Multimedia has found its position in some form as an educational technology platform in the contemporary environment of academic universities. The use of virtual reality software as an intellectual tool and learning provider allows students to perform cognitive rehabilitation of preexisting information frameworks. People are paying more and more attention to how preschoolers' holistic skills develop as education reform progresses. Drama education is incorporated into the school curriculum to enhance young children's artistic, intellectual, and linguistic skills. Therefore, this study aims to examine the potential of multimedia-based virtual reality technology (MVRT) in drama education. The participants in this study were students from different universities in China. Students were exposed to multimedia-based virtual reality technology, and its efficacy was assessed using a statistical analytic approach called Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Drama understanding rate, educational improvement ratio, teaching quality rate, student achievement ratio, computation time, and parental support rate are among the performance metrics used to assess performance. Multimedia-based virtual reality technology (MVRT) for drama education showed outstanding success, with a 98% improvement ratio in educational outcomes and higher teaching quality. Students exhibited improved performance, supported by solid parental approval, demonstrating the effectiveness of MVRT in enhancing educational experiences.

AB Extant literature suggested that committing immoral actions in video games may elicit feelings of guilt and encourage prosocial outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research that examined how decision-making involving various moral foundations in video games can influence players' intergroup perceptions. Therefore, this study examined how players' in-game decisions with respect to the six moral foundations and interactions with different non-player characters' (NPCs') identities influenced their attitudes toward outgroup foreign immigrants. A 2 (video game scenarios: moral choices vs. non-moral choices) by 3 (NPCs' nationality: all citizens vs. citizens and foreigners vs. all foreigners) experiment was conducted (N = 300). There was no main interaction effect across conditions. Participants who interacted with only citizen NPCs reported significantly more positive post-game attitudes toward immigrants than those who interacted with both citizen and foreigner characters. Participants who violated the care/harm, ingroup/loyalty, and liberty/oppression foundations experienced higher levels of guilt, but this had no impact on their immigrant attitudes. However, those who violated the fairness/reciprocity and liberty/oppression foundations reported poorer intergroup attitudes. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB With the application of artificial intelligence technology in sports activity monitoring, new technologies such as interactive robots and the Internet of Things are being more widely used, which can provide entertainment and interactive guidance for sports training. This article analyzes the research on human pose recognition and sports activity monitoring of entertainment robots based on artificial intelligence interaction. This paper designs and develops an entertainment robot system that can recognize human posture and monitor physical activities. Users can interact with the robot and get real-time feedback about their posture and activities, thereby improving motor skills and physical fitness. After in-depth analysis of the theory of dynamic Bayesian network, we used EM algorithm to build a dynamic Bayesian network model, carried out detailed research on the random variables represented by the nodes of the dynamic model, and used the Internet of Things human posture recognition technology to extract the features of human behavior according to the characteristics of human behavior. The results show that the attitude recognition accuracy can be improved by adding the dynamic Bayesian network based on the random forest algorithm. The entertainment robot can accurately identify human posture and monitor sports activities, and has good real-time and stability. Through interaction with the robot, users can get personalized suggestions for individual postures and activities, improving the training effect and enjoyment of physical activities. Therefore, through the in-depth research and analysis of the dynamic Bayesian network and the human posture recognition of the Internet of Things, it is found that the sports activity monitoring system proposed in this paper can comprehensively monitor students' sports activities, so as to achieve the goal of comprehensively improving students' physical fitness.

AB With the development of education and technology, teachers have gradually realized that games should not be just a way for students to entertain themselves. Applying games to teaching resources can achieve better teaching outcomes. However, related resources are constantly emerging on the internet. To achieve higher quality recommendations, a personalized recommendation model for educational video game resources based on knowledge graphs is proposed. Firstly, feature extraction is performed alternately on the user side and the item side. Then a hidden Markov model is introduced on the basis of the dual end neighbor algorithm. Considering the temporal nature of the user, the model is optimized. The optimized model takes into account the long-term and short-term preferences of users and mines their potential preferences. Through experimental analysis, the hit rate index value of the designed model reaches 0.7989. The normalized cumulative gain value of the broken line is 0.6045. More than 89 % of users are satisfied with the recommendation of this model. The running time is 0.2863 s. The constructed model can achieve efficient and high -quality recommendation of educational video game resources, providing users with a more convenient and efficient online experience.

AB The relationship between esports and cognitive performance has recently gained interest in scientific research. Specifically, the cognitive characteristics of popular gaming genres such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (MOBA) and First -Person Shooter (FPS) are needed to be explained. This present study aimed to compare cognitive abilities and reveal the differences between players who regularly play MOBA and FPS games. The participants were divided according to the game genres into MOBA players (n = 17; game experience = 9.17 +/- 2.21 years) and FPS players (n = 22; game experience = 10.90 +/- 3.62 years). Four cognitive tests (i.e., Change Detection, Mackworth Clock, Timewall, and Flanker Test) were administered to the participants via a computerized test battery. The data of the different groups were statistically compared. In the Mackworth Clock Test, FPS players had a higher percentage of correct answers than MOBA players (p =.02). The number of correct answers and reaction times obtained from the Flanker test by FPS players were higher compared to MOBA players (p =.02 and p =.01, respectively). This study revealed that the sustained attention, reaction time, and inhibition skills of FPS players are better than MOBA players. These findings may help to shed light on some of the cognitive abilities that might be more relevant to the FPS genres.

AB The lag in course construction has led to some teaching content and methods not being well adapted to the characteristics of online teaching. Collected student face data and advanced facial recognition algorithms to automatically recognize student avatars, ensuring the accuracy of each student's identity. During the course, facial recognition attendance technology will automatically recognize students' attendance status and record it, thereby obtaining attendance data at any time during the teaching process. The attendance records of students are generated in real-time and easily imported into the academic affairs system for management and statistics. By applying facial recognition attendance technology, teachers can understand students' attendance in real-time and take timely measures to improve their learning enthusiasm. Students also use this technology to more conveniently sign in, reducing potential omissions and errors in the attendance process.

AB This study investigates the impact of game live streaming on gameplay from the perspectives of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and observational learning. To address the impact of game live streaming, we collected data from two different online game-related platforms: the daily number of game players from Steam and the daily number of the game live streaming viewers from Twitch of 10,690 games. Fixed-effects panel regression and pooled OLS analyses were performed on the collected data. The results showed that game live streaming has a positive effect on the number of game players. In addition, the effect of live streaming on the number of storybased game players was weaker than that on the number of non-story-based game players.

AB Co-designing and co-creating technology have recently received much attention in the child-computer interaction (CCI) community. However, there has yet to be much work to explore the co-designing aspect in the field of children's cybersecurity awareness and parental involvement. With this study, we present the results of a codesign activity with ten children between 9 and 12 years to explore how children think about different cybersecurity issues and parents' roles in those cybersecurity-related situations. Our findings show that children expect various adult roles to provide support to ensure their safety online and especially expect their parents to take a supportive role in cybersecurity experiences by informing them about the risks, offering suggestions on mitigating or protective measures, and helping them take protective measures or actions against any entity posing the risks. Our study contributes to understanding children's perceptions of cybersecurity and parental involvement through storytelling.

AB Marketing strategies are being revolutionised by rise of consumer-generated data as well as expanding availability of Machine Learning (ML) tools. It is highly unlikely that academics and marketers fully comprehend the myriad of options that machine learning (ML) applications provide for establishing and preserving a competitive economic edge. Despite the catastrophic, unequal, oppressive effects of algorithmic bias on different client groups, research in this area is still lacking despite the enormous increase of algorithmic decision making in marketing. This study fills this gap by presenting a paradigm that uses the micro foundations of dynamic capacity to uncover the causes of algorithmic bias in marketing. Purpose of this research is to create a fresh method to entertainment analysis for machine learning-based business management decision making. In this study, a game model using fuzzy swarm Gaussian recursive neural networks is developed for entertainment analysis in social network-based business intelligence and decision making modelling. The MSE, MAE, f-1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, and precision are all included in the experimental study. We provide a methodology to provide a dynamic method management capacity to address algorithmic bias in ML-based marketing decision making by combining several points of view utilising theories as well as practices.

AB Social robots, as an important research object in the field of human -computer interaction, have enormous potential in simulating human social behavior and providing personalized services. This study aims to enhance the user experience of music interaction with social robots by constructing a social robot interaction model and combining sensor technology. The study sorted out relevant social psychology theories and methods of emotional computing, as well as theories related to music perception and expression in social robot design. By designing experimental scenarios, the interaction behavior between participants and social robots was observed, combined with gesture sensing processing and speech interaction enhancement processing, to improve the quality and effectiveness of interaction with social robots. We used simulation experiments to simulate the music interaction between users and social robots, in order to verify the reliability and stability of the social robot interaction model. Finally, human -machine electronic music interaction simulation was achieved, and user emotion collection and interaction simulation were carried out. By collecting physiological signals and emotional feedback from users, we have gained a deeper understanding of their emotional experience in music interaction, and through interaction simulation, we have regulated and guided their emotions.

However, detecting stealing activities within surveillance footage remains a challenge. The global issue of stealing leads to significant casualties and financial losses annually. There has been limited research on efficient techniques to identify this anomaly. In this manuscript, an efficient multi-scale attention-based convolutional neural network with skill optimization algorithm (MSAC-SOA) is proposed for detecting theft during day and night in surveillance videos. This approach integrates with the enhanced singleshot multibook detector (ESSD) for object detection in video footage, facilitating the precise identification and localization of objects within each frame. Subsequently, the proposed MSAC-SOA effectively detects and classifies instances of stealing. Finally, a theft detection alert message is sent to the control room. This approach is assessed with two datasets: University of Central Florida (UCF) crime dataset for daytime theft detection and real-time video data for nighttime theft detection. The proposed method demonstrates faster computation times compared to previous techniques, highlighting its efficiency and suitability in terms of various merits for real-life videos of diverse scenarios. It exhibits robust performance across various metrics, including 99.88% accuracy, 99.66% precision, 100% recall, 99.89% F1-score, 99.83% area under the ROC curve (AUC), and 99.83% specificity.

AB With the rapid development of smart Internet of Things technology, education is also starting to use this technology to improve the learning experience. As an art subject, vocal music teaching has many limitations in the traditional face-to-face teaching methods, and e -learning provides new possibilities for vocal music network teaching. We analyze the problems and challenges existing in the traditional face-to-face mode of vocal music teaching, and then based on the intelligent Internet of Things technology, we design a vocal music network teaching experience system. The system combines sound acquisition equipment, intelligent audio processing algorithm, virtual classroom and other technologies to realize the simulation experience of online vocal music teaching. We have developed an intelligent audio processing algorithm for analyzing and processing students ' singing sounds. This algorithm can detect problems in tone, timbre, rhythm, and more, and provide real-time feedback and advice. In this way, students can understand the shortcomings of their own singing skills, and make timely adjustments and improvements. This study shows that e -learning based on intelligent Internet of Things technology has important application value in vocal music network teaching. By simulating the classroom environment and providing real-time feedback, students can obtain a better learning experience and improve their vocal skills.

AB Currently, the contradiction between traditional English teaching and the need for dynamic learning is becoming increasingly prominent. Therefore, the organic integration of new teaching aids with traditional English teaching is conducive to achieving a new concept design and innovation in English teaching. On this basis, a large-scale English teaching corpus was established by combining MapReduce with Apache Hadoop algorithm. At the same time, information theory and methods based on the MapReduce computing model are proposed and applied to the parallelism analysis of big data, effectively solving practical problems that are difficult to expand certain datasets. Secondly, this article will design a new algorithm, Salsa20, based on the construction characteristics of Apache Hadoop. By utilizing the parallel characteristics of this algorithm, we can parallelize the Apache Hadoop algorithm, improve the system's data processing ability, ensure the security of data in MapReduce operation mode, and ensure its efficient data processing ability. In addition, the comprehensive and systematic use of largescale corpora to establish an English teaching system based on them can effectively improve some of the problems that arise in English teaching, greatly enhance the teaching effectiveness of English courses.

AB The Adaptive Mixed Reality Robot Games (AMRRG) framework represents an innovative approach to integrating consumer robots into public spaces for personalized and engaging entertainment. AMRRG uses a combination of mixed reality headsets, robot movement, and interactive objects. These responsive entertainment environments need a new way to tell their story. Admixing game mechanics algorithm utilizes the world's most advanced depth perception, computer vision, and simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) to enable effective distinguishing between player spaces, mixed reality areas, and robot paths for safe interaction. Reinforcement learning enables real-time adaptation of game difficulty and gameplay mechanics as players react to it. At 35 % higher than traditional video-game installations in a 5 m x 5 m environment accommodating up to 20 people, adaptive algorithms recorded efficiency values of 92 % and responsiveness of 98 %. The AMRRG framework brings home consumer robot platforms to deliver a happy gaming experience. Future research will explore the potential of AMRRG beyond simple adaptation, extending its use to therapy and education.

AB The rise of innovative methods has increased the implementation of robotics into daily existence. Improving human-robot interactions (HRI) to create customised relationships is essential to promote consumer acceptability and pleasure in this setting. This article investigates using behavioural artificial intelligence in the modern environment framework to customise HRI. A higher degree of involvement and camaraderie will be attained by giving entertaining robots (enbots) the capacity to sense, comprehend, and react to our feelings. Using psychological artificial intelligence methods, such machines can modify their actions, appearances, and replies based on personal desires and psychological conditions, resulting in increasingly customised and engaging customer interactions. Nevertheless, even such enbots remain unable to identify humans' feelings. This study proposes a method for adjusting enbot features based on an employee's psychological condition to accomplish this. The technique uses Electroencephalography (EEG) technologies to digitise and interpret human feelings. The enbot's settings will alter immediately to sustain the individual's feelings within a desired span, boosting mutual trust and respect between the two entities.

AB Traditional E -learning usually lacks real-time feedback and interactivity, which can not meet the needs of students' personalized learning. Computer English communication is an important aspect of cultivating students' language communication ability, which has a positive impact on students' learning results. In order to realize the real-time feedback of computer English communication and E -learning intelligent entertainment experience, this study stimulates students' learning interest and improves their learning effect by providing real-time feedback and personalized learning content. With the development of computer network technology, E -learning English platforms can provide students with intelligent entertainment experiences and real-time learning feedback. This article analyzes the real-time feedback and E -learning intelligent entertainment experience of computer English communication based on deep learning. Firstly, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the characteristics of English communication. English communication has specific grammatical structures and professional terms, which require quick and accurate understanding and expression of information. On this basis, a training dataset was constructed, preprocessed and annotated, cleaned to remove irrelevant information and noise, and then corresponding labels were added to each data sample. Subsequently, the constructed dataset was used to optimize the deep learning and recurrent neural network models, and the model parameters were optimized using a backpropagation algorithm. The experimental results show that the method designed in this article has higher accuracy and real-time performance, can timely identify learners' problems and provide personalized feedback, accurately evaluate learners' communication ability, and provide targeted feedback.

AB The media landscape has been evolving at a dizzying pace in recent years, with short video platforms emerging as a significant public information conduit; yet, it must be acknowledged that the impact of these platforms on transmission is still rather limited. Both the width and the depth are not up to par. Improving the impact, increasing the reach and impact, and making the most of the Douyin platform for scientific communication activity is an immediate concern. Douyin, China's most popular video-sharing platform, with 400 million daily users. Douyin provides regular individuals with the resources they need to start their own video art careers; it is popular outside of tier 1 cities. There are also inventive contests on the site where individuals can try their hand at being famous overnight. In this study, we look at how social media platforms evaluate short video head accounts online. Research is conducted to separate out the communication features of the head accounts based on popular scientific themes, the length of the form, and the use of other platform functions in the operation process. This study use random theory to pick various sorts of short videos as the final effective analysis samples, with a random sampling range of 15% of the empirical sample size, in order to deal with the temporal dimension and the enormous number of online video samples. Among the topics covered by Douyin's popular scientific short video accounts, the percentages for science, technology, innovations, medical care, health, and nature stand at 18.99%, 16.59%, and 15.38%, respectively, according to the article's sample data. Online video and film may be effectively disseminated in this research's media ecosystem, which is based on sampling theory.

AB This study investigates the intricate causal mechanisms of sustained engagement in long-term online gamified learning among university students, situated within the theoretical frameworks of TAM, ECT, and TPB. Employing a purposive sampling strategy, 1551 university students from the Greater Bay Area of China were included in the study. Methodologically, sophisticated statistical analyses, including Mplus for measurement and path analyses, and fsQCA for configurational analysis, were conducted. The results highlight significant insights: perceived entertainment positively influences attitude confirmation and sustained engagement; individual characteristics positively impact perceived usefulness, perceived entertainment, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; a chain-mediated effect intricately links usage expectation, individual characteristics, perceived entertainment, and sustained engagement; immersion experience moderates the relationship between perceived entertainment and sustained engagement. Furthermore, these pivotal factors dynamically configure themselves in diverse pathways, collectively shaping students' sustained engagement behavior through intricate interactions. The research findings have revealed various mechanisms of college students' sustained engagement in online gamified learning, offering detailed insights into the profound and indirect influences shaping sustained engagement behavior. This enriches and advances the current theoretical understanding.

AB This paper in order to achieve the application of artificial intelligence based social robots in the process of student mental health diagnosis. When designing the architecture of social robots, factors such as interactivity, adaptability, and scalability were taken into consideration to ensure that they possess human like interaction characteristics and flexibility. Subsequently, a model was constructed based on deep learning technology to achieve functions such as sentiment classification, text mining, and optimization strategies. The input data set of the training model comes from the user 's interaction records and behavior data on the Internet social platform, as well as the user 's feedback information in the process of using the robot. The research on psychological data classification has constructed corresponding algorithms based on pointer networks and text models to achieve text feature extraction and classification. The psychological emotion mining module extracts emotional states from user discourse and maps them to corresponding categories of psychological problems. Finally, based on the user input question content, classify and optimize psychological problems. Research has shown that the robot has certain accuracy and practicality in data classification and student mental health diagnosis.

This study aims to develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent parallelism to enhance intelligent decision-making in game environments. The algorithm combines a deep Q-network with a multi-agent cooperation strategy. Through parallel training of multiple agents, the learning process is accelerated, and decision accuracy is improved. The experimental results indicated that the Actor-Critic algorithm, when combined with precision rate, recall rate, and average fitness of multi-agent parallel, achieves a relatively high accuracy rate index, which stabilizes above 0.95. The recall rate index was also above 0.8, and the average fitness was in a relatively high range. The research shows that the deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent parallelism performs better and is more effective in game environments. It can learn the optimal strategy faster and obtain higher rewards. This not only provides a new technical means for game development but also offers a useful reference for the application of multi-agent systems in complex environments.

AB The effects of digitization and globalization have led to amazing advancements in internet and smartphone technologies. Particularly as the number of users rises, smartphones have emerged as a necessity for young people as well as kids. In this environment, the growing incidence of behavioral problems among young individuals has become an unavoidable consequence attributed to the growing number of users and the proliferation of diverse social media (SM) platforms. Therefore, concern about internet misuse and the utilization of SM in a harmful manner has emerged. This phenomenon has an important effect on the social habits of young persons, and it is also associated with the development of mental illnesses. Additionally, alongside the emergence of significant challenges in the social world of individuals in the college -age demographic, there are instances of deficiencies in their study habits. Hence, the primary objective of our study is to investigate the SM patterns among college learners and evaluate the impact of SM on learners across multiple factors. The data for this research was collected using an online survey administered to a sample of 355 college learners enrolled in educational institutions in Haryana. The research incorporated the use of Personal Information Form and Social Media Addiction Scales specifically designed for both young people and adult populations. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS software programs. In the evaluation of research data, an important relationship was observed between the duration of SM usage among college learners and their performance on SM addiction assessments, including individuals of all genders. The prohibited nature of learners' SM use at the college has been found to hurt their social relationships and academic performance.

AB To improve the mental health rehabilitation effect of college students, this paper combines the self-regulated music psychotherapy method to study the effect of mental health rehabilitation intervention on college students. Moreover, this paper continuously detects psychological stress based on heart rate variability and successfully realizes the continuous detection of psychological stress in exams by using a short time scale and effective heart rate variability characteristics. In addition, this paper evaluates the effect by establishing a psychological rehabilitation model and mathematical statistics methods. Finally, the effectiveness of the mental health rehabilitation method for college students, rooted in self-regulated music psychotherapy, was validated through both practical experimentation and simulation studies. The findings from both the real-world application and the simulated environment consistently demonstrated positive outcomes, affirming the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB In gamified learning, user engagement has always been an important concern in the field of education. For mass learning, the integration of classroom learning and gamification can make users well -stimulated and help them to improve and cultivate their comprehensive abilities. With the characteristics of efficiency, fairness, and objectivity, online assessment systems (OJ systems) have become an important tool for learning. However, the following limitations still exist in current OJ systems: First, most OJ systems cannot perceive and quantify the user's learning level at the knowledge point level. This can lead to a mismatch between the difficulty of study questions adapted by the system to the user and the user's learning ability; second, most OJ systems lack research and design of motivation methods. These limitations can negatively affect the enhancement of students' motivation and the consolidation and improvement of their learning ability. Given this, the article designs and implements a gamified online assessment system (Game_OJ) based on user participation and the game chemistry process. The online assessment system uses a modified Bayesian knowledge tracking model (CC-BKT). The application of the Bayesian knowledge tracking model can accurately perceive and quantify students' learning of each knowledge point. The online assessment system introduces the gamification idea to design the motivation methods in the OJ system, including the design of gamification elements and the design of the challenge process of gamified learning, aiming to enhance students' motivation to learn. It promotes students' deep learning in the classroom and outside the classroom. The CC-KPT model proposed in this paper has an average increase of 2.15 % in AUG value and an average increase of 3.25 % in accuracy compared to the same type of model, and the speed of response and the median speed of processing demand of this system is within 1 s when 500 users use the system at the same time, which meets the needs of on -campus teaching scenarios.

AB This research investigates the further prospects of TV and internet video services in the dynamic Yemen market by analyzing the factors that influence their use and engagement. This research expands its framework by including the combined concept of absorption and employ of technologies, and the idea of technology disruptions and systems improvement adding an entertaining bend to the analysis. Its purpose is to investigate the connection between the intention to use and the behaviour of interacting with the material. The research subjects were answered by a group of 400 academic graduates. In contrast to previous studies, this study discovered that only the Perceived Ease of Use (PES) is effectively connected with the desire to use online video services. However, it also revealed a significant optimistic connection between customer quality Online Flow Experience (OFE), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBO), and Instrumental Orientation (IR), the purpose to employ internet video services. Findings indicate a decline in TV viewership, while the limited amount of available money may pose a significant obstacle to the expansion of video platforms. This study provides vital insights into the evolving consumer behavior inside Yeman's media network at a period of minimal investigation.

AB Currently, artificial intelligence and virtual technology are widely used in motion monitoring. Virtual entertainment robots can provide adaptive and personalized fitness services for different user groups, allowing users to experience the exercise process in games. This article studies the virtual entertainment robot based on artificial intelligence image capture system for sports and fitness posture recognition. Firstly, this article explores deep learning methods for motion recognition. By constructing a generative adversarial network to obtain discrimination results, and calculating its anti-loss function. This approach can improve the efficiency of human body movement style conversion through adversarial training. Finally, through the evaluation of movement posture and action recognition, quantitative evaluation results and targeted guidance strategies can be provided to help correct incorrect movements and master correct techniques. Using motion capture systems to identify user movements during exercise not only accurately extracts user fitness movement information, but also makes it easier to use and reduces user costs. The system uses motion evaluation techniques for evaluation to help users correct incorrect fitness habits, prevent exercise losses, and exercise more safely and effectively.

AB With the continuous expansion of the translation market, users ' demand for translation tools such as computer software is also increasing, resulting in various machine translation technologies and methods. Japanese translation, as one of the important components of Chinese publicity work, has strong professionalism and complexity. In practice, how to effectively improve the translation quality of Japanese translation models using computer technology has always been a research issue of great concern. Based on this, we propose a game search algorithm and use it as a prototype to improve the algorithm. Then, a data mining model was established that can effectively improve search performance. This model solves the above problems by introducing genetic algorithms and dynamic programming theory. At the same time, in order to further improve the efficiency of existing data mining algorithms, we need to explore more efficient methods and strategies. After experimental verification, the four data mining models proposed in this article perform the best in numerical fitting. Overall, in Japanese multi context translation systems, the use of data mining techniques based on computer game search algorithms can provide more accurate and matching related translations. Compared to traditional Japanese translation software, it has higher quality and efficiency.

DE Word bag model; Recurrent neural network algorithm; English vocabulary;
   Learning recommendation system
AB This article takes learning English vocabulary as the foundation, constructs precise classification strategies, and designs a recommendation system for English vocabulary learning. This article constructs a recommendation system for English vocabulary learning based on the word bag calculation model and recursive neural network calculation method, which has great significance, and also conducts in-depth research on this system. Thus, a classification calculation method based on the word bag calculation model was proposed. The calculation method in this paper is different from traditional calculation methods, and the classification accuracy in this paper is higher. Meanwhile, recurrent neural networks themselves have one or more feedback loops that can feed back information from the neural network to other neural networks, resulting in recurrent networks with different structures. After a series of research results, it has been found that the SIFT method takes longer to extract than the SURF method, and the number of extracted features is relatively large. Therefore, the recommendation system for English vocabulary learning proposed in this article can be improved according to the different needs of users, in order to better meet their individual requirements.

AB This paper presents a structured series of lessons for teaching undergraduate computer science or game development students how to construct a game engine using C++ and standard graphics APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX. Our proposed course content discusses rendering topics, game object management, scene management, and rigid body physics where learners are tasked to incorporate them into a fully functional prototype scene editor. By incorporating actual coding into the course, students can gain a better understanding of low-level engine features and also hone their programming skills. In addition to the learning content, we provide recommended assessment methods. We include discussions about our teaching experience in handling a game engine architecture course, titled GDENG03, which 36 students have passed. Our paper stands out from related works by providing a framework for interested educators on how to write a 3D game engine and how to teach the same in class. Based on our actual delivery of GDENG03, all 36 students achieved high scores of >80% out of 100 which demonstrates the effectiveness of our learning content. We received positive student feedback, such as a better appreciation of game engines, while suggestions for course improvement were raised, such as using simpler terminologies and better workload management. Based on student scores and feedback, we can attribute the success of our students' learning to our inclusion of practical coding examples and discussions, highlighting their relevance to mainstream game engines.

AB With the continuous development of digital technology, music teaching is gradually shifting from traditional face-to-face teaching to online teaching and intelligent learning methods. Developing music teaching software plays an important role in improving users' music learning methods and learning experience. However, current music teaching software still has issues such as poor compatibility, low level of data security and privacy protection, and functional requirements that are still in the early stages. This article aimed to research and develop a music teaching software based on neural network algorithm and user analysis, so as to improve user satisfaction with music teaching software. In the article, the overall design module of the system was first analyzed, and then music teaching resource data was collected and normalized using clustering algorithms to improve the effectiveness of music teaching resource data. Afterwards, a BP (Back Propagation) neural network model with parallel structure was used to optimize the design of the neural network model, and the effectiveness of the neural network model in user interface design was analyzed. Finally, user behavior analysis and personalized recommendation were achieved by constructing a user profile feature dataset. In order to verify the performance of the developed music teaching software, the software performance and security were tested. The results showed that the required loading time for the music score data in test case 1 of this article was only 1.21 s, and the response time was only 0.015 s. At this time, the security was 92.6%; the required loading time for audio data was only 1.06 s. The response time was only 0.019 s, and the security was 88.7%; the loading time required for user interaction data was only 0.78 s. The response time was only 0.012 s, and the safety was 91.3%. The research results indicated that the music teaching software developed in this article could better meet users' music teaching needs and provide users with a more intelligent, personalized, and efficient music learning experience.

AB Entertainment robots, as a new type of entertainment device, have broad application prospects. Entertainment robots provide entertainment and entertainment experiences through interaction with users. This article designs a programming model to interpret and execute user gesture commands, and convert them into drawing actions that robots can process. By interacting with entertainment robots, users can guide robots to draw through gestures, making artistic creations more intuitive and interesting. We used deep learning algorithms for training and used existing art works as references to enable robots to learn and imitate the painting styles of different artists. Finally, by optimizing the algorithm, the optimal path for the entertainment robot to draw trajectories was determined, which improved the effectiveness and quality of the painting. Through the training of deep learning algorithms, entertainment robots can capture the characteristics and details of an artist's painting style, and simulate it during the painting process. This provides users with a personalized artistic creation experience, allowing them to interact with entertainment robots, participate in artistic creation, and experience a creative process similar to that of real artists.

AB E-learning video is an effective teaching tool, and virtual reality technology can enhance the learning experience. However, the current English teaching platform lacks the personalized and real-time feedback video recommendation system. Therefore, this study proposes an E-learning video recommendation system based on virtual reality environment, which aims to provide a personalized, interactive and real-time feedback learning experience. In this paper, the prototype of E-learning video recommendation system based on virtual reality environment is designed, and the simulation experiment is carried out on the English teaching platform. In the environment of the E-learning platform, human -computer interaction and entertainment media can enhance students ' learning process and assist in teaching work. This article analyzes the simulation of E-learning video recommendation based on virtual reality environment on English teaching platforms. The E-learning video recommendation system can create user profiles on the website based on their basic information and behavior, fully tap into their preferences, and provide personalized learning services for them. The recommendation system can be divided into two parts: offline and online. Offline systems are mainly responsible for creating video related content, while online systems store data in databases, allowing for real-time investigation and retrieval of data; Online systems can respond to user requests in real-time, and combining online extraction with user behavior analysis can generate the final recommendation results. While constructing an artificial intelligence platform for English teaching, it is also necessary to propose application strategies for English teaching and achieve modernization of curriculum teaching.

AB Role-playing games (RPGs) are interactive gaming experiences designed and driven by the intricate development of narratives and characters. However, these games also highlight elements, such as combat, exploration, creativity, and crafting. Game developers helped to shape the market by incorporating RPGs into digital media; however, they suffered restrictions in their game design and storytelling caused by technological limitations. Fortunately, academia has studied these challenges and mitigated these latter issues to better understand and connect digital RPGs with their analog versions. Our research offers a comprehensive overview of studies centered on technologies for managing, generating, and controlling digital RPG elements. We aim to characterize Artificial Intelligence research within this domain and elucidate the diverse techniques employed. In this context, we examined 72 papers about Procedural Content Generation (PCG) in RPG, which were identified by mixing a database search with a snowballing method. In this paper, we provide an overview of PCG techniques investigated within the realm of RPGs and present the trending approaches for future developments in the field.

AB With the development of digital technology and the popularity of the Internet, e-learning has become an increasingly popular learning method. However, current e-learning systems often lack personalization and intelligence, and cannot meet the different learning needs of students. This paper designed an intelligent e-learning system using adaptive learning algorithm and artificial intelligence technology. The system aims to provide a personalized learning experience to help students efficiently master the knowledge of art courses. We introduce in detail the design and implementation of the intelligent e-learning system, which uses the adaptive learning algorithm to continuously adjust the learning content and learning methods by analyzing the students' learning behaviors and characteristics. The system provide intelligent tutoring and evaluation functions to help students with autonomous learning and feedback. By comparing the experiment with the traditional e-learning system, we find that the intelligent e-learning system has significant advantages in improving the learning effect and learning motivation. After using the intelligent e-learning system, students' knowledge mastery and learning interest have been significantly improved.

AB This article collected a large number of writing samples from computer English learners, which included various types of writing errors. Subsequently, natural language processing techniques were used to extract and preprocess the features of these writing samples. Select the decision tree algorithm as the construction method for the error classification model, and classify the samples by constructing a tree like structure. In the process of building the model, writing samples are used as training sets, feature values are used to determine the type of writing errors, and they are classified. Based on the classification results of the model for samples, corresponding correction suggestions and improvement strategies are provided. A fault classification model based on natural language processing and decision tree algorithm is constructed, and corresponding correction suggestions and improvement strategies are provided. This model has shown good results in experiments and evaluations, and can accurately identify and correct various common writing errors. The research results indicate that the method is effective in helping computer English learners improve their writing ability and accuracy. Future research will further explore other machine learning algorithms and technologies to further improve the effectiveness of error classification and correction.

AB Sports can combine virtual reality technology with high-precision training to enhance the training effectiveness of users. In view of the current problems of insufficient physical quality and lack of exercise motivation faced by college students, this paper aims to explore a new type of college sports game teaching model through the integration of virtual reality technology. This is to improve students 'physical exercise efficiency and subjective initiative. This study constructed an experiential sports game model by applying posture recognition technology and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The research indicated that the error accuracy with residual structure added will quickly decrease. When calculating the error, the overall error decreased by 6 mm. The proposed method can accurately distinguish human behavior in motion and trajectories in the motion area. The motion capture accuracy was high, and the deformation amount met the teaching needs of higher education institutions for sports game teaching. The contribution of this study is the significant improvement in the accuracy of motion capture, resulting in a total error reduction to 6 mm. This improvement ensured that the model can accurately distinguish between motion behavior and trajectory. The cumulative variance explanation rate of the scale reached 712.407 %, which was far more than that of the traditional model, and fully covered and explained the questionnaire information. Through the comparative test with four knowledge tracking models, the effectiveness and superiority of the sports game teaching mode integrated with virtual reality technology were verified.

AB Aim: Vocabulary is the base for communication and vocabulary deficits reduce effective social communication. This study aims to develop and analyze English language-based assistive gaming technology to support individuals with vocabulary deficits. Materials and methods: The developed intervention is based on deep learning technology for next word prediction, and it is equipped with web and mobile application interaction support. Various deep learning models, including long short-term memory, bidirectional long short-term memory, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, were learned and deployed using an open-source dataset corpus. The proposed intervention was analyzed using a specified task of a 5-minute lecture on a simple technical topic. The completed activities were also evaluated by professionals using vocabulary-related expert characteristics. Results: The results of the conducted 5-minute task on social domain without intervention and later with intervention improved. The results were assessed by counting vocabulary words as well as by vocabulary specialists. The levels of central tendencies and deviations changed as the task improved with the proposed intervention. Mean, median, and standard deviation scores of the experimental group improved significantly (189.1, 194.0, and 67.61) in comparison to the control group (125.4, 127.0, and 43.55). Furthermore, language specialists observed significant differences in the mean and median without intervention (12.84 and 13.0) compared to the intervention group (24.23 and 24.0, respectively). Conclusions: The outcome of the experiments appears to be in favor of the suggested intervention. As a result, the suggested deep learning based next word prediction aided assistive gaming technology could support persons in overcoming their limited vocabulary disadvantages. In the future, the integration of the proposed technology into existing communication enhancement technology could achieve better results.

AB This study showed that using collaborative entertainment robots for human-robot interaction can be a promising way to help manage the health of ageing populations by automatically detecting and mitigating cognitive impairment. The system enhanced spoken interaction with users by using cutting-edge technologies such as stateof-the-art speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning. The system was tested on senior participants and gathered, analyzed, and displayed individual interaction models to provide automated user engagement, daily interaction monitoring, and automatic early detection of deteriorating mental health. The findings were presented using bar charts and confusion matrices, incorporating important metrics such as mental workload and speech/non-speech interaction graphic. These visualizations aided individuals in managing their behavior to achieve an optimal cognitive workload, a challenging measure to determine due to cognitive decline. In order to make significant progress in the subject, future advancements need to focus on addressing the unpredictability in human speech sequences, using non-speech modalities such as gestures or facial expressions as supplementary inputs to complement speech and behavior, and effectively managing concerns related to human rights and data protection. In addition to technological constraints, future research should prioritize the examination of the enduring impacts of cognitive therapies facilitated by entertainment robots.

AB With the assistance of digital new media technology, virtual entertainment robots, as a new learning experience mode, can effectively enhance the interactive process of e-learning learning. This article studies the application of entertainment robots based on digital new media in real -time error correction mode for Chinese English translation. Through experiments, it has been verified that the flexible use of deep learning technology can significantly improve user satisfaction and translation accuracy, and has already improved the level of error correction and positioning. This article first introduces the existing mainstream machine learning models, including supervised neural network models and attention mechanisms. On this basis, the system was optimized to further improve its performance. At the same time, this article proposes new improvement plans to address the shortcomings of current mainstream translation systems. We conducted comparative experiments on the error correction model of the proposed adaptive algorithm for specific error types, and also tested it using real datasets. Research has shown that using adaptive algorithms based on reinforcement deep learning can not only significantly optimize the error correction efficiency of our system, but also flexibly adapt to the needs of various optimization strategies.

AB The role of social networks in distance education cannot be ignored. Through social networking platforms, students can communicate and interact with other classmates, share learning experiences and problem-solving methods, and provide learning support and encouragement to each other. However, traditional English learning platforms have problems such as limited content and lack of interactivity. This article collects and analyzes learners' historical learning data, establishes learners' learning models, and learns about their learning habits, preferences, and other information. Subsequently, a collaborative filtering algorithm is used to match learners with other learners with similar learning behaviors and interest preferences, identify similar groups of learners, refer to the choices and preferences of learners who are similar to them, and recommend suitable learning resources for them. In addition to personalized recommendations, this article also designs a comprehensive set of social functions to promote interaction and knowledge sharing among learners. The results showed that the effectiveness and feasibility of the designed English learning social platform were verified through analysis and experimentation of actual user data. User feedback shows that the personalized recommendations and social functions provided by the platform have significantly improved learning outcomes and communication between learners.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred increased reliance on technology, raising concerns about excessive screen time and its impact on human behaviour. This study provides critical insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on technology usage, daily activities, and social interactions among Australian adults. By employing the Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT) as a theoretical framework, this research investigates the motivations and impacts behind these changes. Data were collected using a cross-sectional online survey in the middle of 2020 (n: 515). Bivariate analyses revealed how individuals pursued gratifications during the pandemic, linking these pursuits to socio-demographic factors and resulting behavioural changes. During the pandemic, most participants preferred using digital communication tools, spending significant time on social media, online streaming services, and text messaging while increasing their use of online meeting platforms. Traditional forms of entertainment and communication declined in popularity, whereas digital communication tools and methods were deemed essential, indicative of evolving societal norms. Those aged 18 -40, students, employed, males, singles/widows/divorcees, and non-parents shifted online device usage toward work and study, while participants aged 41 + and females preferred socialising and entertainment. Younger participants, students and nonparents preferred spending their creation time using mobile, tablet, and PC for social media and online games, while older, employed, and parent participants opted for TV, videos, and outdoor activities. Relationship status influenced work-related activities, with couples and non-parents more likely to leave home for work. Students perceived online interactions as less productive than face-to-face, unlike employed individuals. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of the digital landscape, highlighting the fundamental roles played by digital communication tools and adaptability during crises. Policymakers and researchers should carefully consider various socio-demographic factors when investigating and formulating strategies for diverse groups, particularly in light of the need to adapt to the new normal influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

DE Teaching Gamification; Education Mode; Learning Situation Analysis;
   Recommendation
AB With the development of science and technology, the education model is also constantly evolving. Teaching games is an increasingly concerned educational strategy, which can improve students' interest and participation in learning through gamification. In order to further optimize the effect of teaching gamification, this paper uses a clustering algorithm to analyse students' learning situation and determine the main factors affecting students' participation, including learning motivation, learning tasks, social interaction and game experience. Based on the results of learning situation analysis, the naive Bayes algorithm is used to analyse students learning behaviour. The model can predict students' future learning needs and interests according to their learning history and behaviour, so as to recommend the most suitable gamified learning resources for them. The design and implementation of this model can help to improve the effect of teaching gamification and provide students with a more personalized learning experience. At the same time, the model also helps teachers to better understand students' learning needs and interests, so as to better guide their learning.

AB Humans are thinking beings. Pondering about the purpose of life has always been one of their concerns historically. In this study, an adventure game called Evergreen was created, enabling players to engage in dialoguebased interactions centered around existential issues, with a specific focus on the crisis of meaning. The game draws inspiration from Yalom's existential psychotherapy and seeks to convey profound human concerns through an interactive digital medium. We interviewed experts in psychology and computer games to assess and refine the game. Subsequently, we assessed the levels of meaning in life and the existential thinking among players before and after playing the refined version of the game. The results revealed a positive association between the game and the meaning in life scores of the players [Control group (50.63 +/- 5.18) and Test group (54.60 +/- 8.12), (P = 0.028)]. However, there was no significant relationship between the implementation of the existential game created in the present study and the shifts in the scores on the Scale for Existential Thinking of the intervention group [Control group (33.98 +/- 5.07) and Test group (34.20 +/- 4.74), (P = 0.865)].

AB The tourism industry is a key component in many nations' economies, and precise Forecasting of the number of arrivals of transient international visitors is necessary for efficient resource allocation and strategic planning. Traditional approaches for predicting time series need to catch up when capturing the intricate patterns and interdependencies in data about visitor movement. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a model that combines Ensemble Deep Neural Networks (EDNN) with Long Short-Term Memories (LSTM) to enhance migration predictions. EDNNs learn complex patterns from historical data, whereas LSTMs model sequential relationships. We start with data from the study-based Migration Forecasting for Transitory Foreign Tourists. The data was preprocessed using Adaptive mean filter (AMF) methods. We used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to look at different configurations for extracting features. The EDNN-LSTM method had better results than its comparison in terms of a wide range of performance measures having an accuracy of 97%, an MAE of 40.75%, an MSE of 33.10%, and an RMSE of 30.10%. According to the results, the EDNN-LSTM model can represent the intricate dynamics of transitory foreign visitor movement. Consequently, this model is a useful resource for tourism stakeholders, policymakers, and enterprises.

AB The backbone of the Indian economy, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) players provide rural residents with steady income and long-term employment possibilities. Due to antiquated machinery, ineffective procedures, outdated manufacturing and business methods, and a severe lack of funds to cover their capital and operating costs, Indian MSME operators are finding it difficult to thrive in the cutthroat market of today. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) mistakenly believe that the industry 4.0 ecosystem, which encompasses numerous developing technologies, is exclusively intended for larger corporations. However, SMEs can effectively leverage these technologies to tackle their operational difficulties. This research study offers a unique, purpose-built Industry 4.0 solution to help MSME participants in the Software as a Service (SaaS) model save maintenance costs. With just monthly operating costs, this system provides a scalable and incredibly economical approach that does not require any capital expenditures. This solution includes emerging technologies such as IoT, cloud, analytics, and mobile applications. This solution has been implemented in three MSME businesses from Chennai, India and achieved 84% decrease in maintenance cost.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive survey of machine learning techniques used for dance classification, especially in the context of dances of Indian origin. The advances and challenges in the field of dance classification are also covered. The literature is divided into two categories based on the goal of classification, viz. classification of dances and classification of tasks within a dance. The literature is primarily studied under probabilistic models, rule-based models, geometric models, and neural network-based models. The study also discusses the datasets available for dance classification and the preprocessing and feature extraction techniques used for dance classification. The study also presents a MoveNet-based approach for ICD classification. Finally, the study highlights the challenges involved in dance classification and their possible handling mechanisms.

AB Interactive robots are intelligent auxiliary tools that can monitor sports events in real-time and provide entertainment information services. This article studies the application of entertainment interactive robots based on deep learning in the referee assistance mode of sports competitions. The system first uses a camera to capture real-time images of volleyball matches, then preprocesses the images using image processing algorithms, and uses deep learning algorithms to recognize and track the balls and players in the images. By training the model, the system can accurately determine key information such as player actions. Deep learning technology is used to train interactive entertainment robots to identify and analyze key decision events in games. Through image recognition, action analysis and rule matching, the robot monitors the game process in real time and determines the referee's possible errors in the decision. The system generates the penalty results based on the penalty rules and competition rules, and displays them to the referee and audience through display screens or sound prompts. After experimental verification, the volleyball match referee judgment assistance system based on image processing and deep learning has performed excellently in terms of accuracy and speed. Compared to manual referees, the system can identify and track the ball and players more quickly, reduce the possibility of misjudgments, and improve the fairness of the game.

AB Especially with the rise of artificial intelligence, people need more ability to think logically and make judgments than before. Board games can be used as a tool for training logic, which has a positive effect on the sustainable development of society. Connect6 is a very popular board game because it is a fair and highly complex game with simple rules. This research aims to address the technical challenges of building a game -based logical learning system with a deep neural network for Connect6. We used heuristic knowledge to establish the knowledge base. Our novel algorithm, based on residual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), outperforms conventional approaches. We compare neural network architectures, demonstrating the superiority of residual DCNNs. Our AI program, "Kavalan, " achieves remarkable search performance. Furthermore, the introduced approaches lend themselves to application in other sudden -death board games, such as Gomoku, the endgame of Chess and Shogi.

AB In traditional music teaching method, students passively accept information and lack sufficient interaction and participation. Entertainment robots can provide students with a more interesting and engaging learning experience through means such as multimedia content, gamified elements and interactive design. The goal of this research is to develop a technology based on visual saliency testing to improve the performance of entertainment robots in music teaching systems, making them more intelligent and interactive. The research collected a large number of music multimedia teaching materials, and marked and analyzed them. The visual significance test method is used to determine the key points and important information in the teaching materials, and the computer vision technology is used to identify the areas of visual interest to students in real time. Through interaction with students, the system can adapt its output based on student feedback to ensure personalized exploration and teaching of students' points of interest. Finally, an interactive entertainment robot system is designed, which can perform intelligent feedback and interaction according to the significant information in music teaching materials. The results show that the entertainment robot system based on visual salience test shows higher intelligence and interactivity in music multimedia teaching, which greatly improves the teaching experience.

AB Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) have great potential for improving traffic safety, several questions about their practicality persist. Although it is crucial, doing tests on the road may be risky and costly. An easier, quicker, and less expensive option is to use virtual reality (VR) driving simulators. In this research, we investigate how virtual reality (VR) game simulations may speed up the process of validating the safety of AVs. We suggest building complex dynamic environments using consumer VR game engines to put AVs through their paces. Thanks to the physics modelling and real-time rendering features, you can test your car in realistic conditions. We review the advantages of conventional testing methods, including quickly iterating environments, assessing potentially dangerous edge situations, scaling effectively, and saving money. Additionally, our method enables programmers to collect information and opinions from big groups of real drivers via online games. We draw attention to unanswered questions concerning data-driven simulation adaptation, variability modelling, and fidelity. Achieving thorough, quick, and ethical safety validation has never been more feasible than using gameinspired VR simulations, significantly because the development of AVs is exceeding physical testing. This technique can potentially speed up the safe deployment of autonomous functions by making high-quality simulation more accessible to a broader audience.

AB User-generated game platforms have emerged as a channel fostering creative activities in online communities. Therefore, this study reveals users' decision making at UGG platform such as Roblox, where millions of users contribute to game creation and play the game. In particular, teenagers, who are digital natives and known as Generation Z, select a game from various UGGs on Roblox. Thus, this study focuses on how game creator information in personal profile plays a significant role in determining digital natives' choice of UGG. Drawing the signaling theory, this research focus on creators' abilities and popularities as indicators for UGG choices. We collect a total of 1,301 fighting games from Roblox and game creator information. To address endogeneity, a twostage least squares(2SLS) analysis was conducted using instrumental variables. The results show that the number of limited items and followers achieved by the creator positively affect game popularity.

AB With the development of science and technology, virtual reality and other technologies have gradually developed and popularized, sprouting a series of interdisciplinary, such as evaluation and intervention in the psychological Affective computing. To enhance the realism of virtual situational materials for psychological intervention, this study proposed the application of point cloud 3D generated gameplay virtual scenarios in induced psychological intervention. It utilized the Kneading Net model to construct a point cloud 3D generation deep learning network, and combined style transfer algorithm to construct an emotion induced monomer model. Finally, the complete scene was constructed using the key technology of the positive feedback psychological emotion induced scene production system. The experimental data showed that when the three modules of cube cavity template, geometric feature and dynamic chamfer distance in the Kneading Net model were used meanwhile, the common chamfer distance was 0.0240, which was 0.0003 lower than the original network. This indicated that the simultaneous use of the three modules can achieve optimal network performance and can be applied in scenarios with high accuracy requirements. The comprehensive scores of scene realism and immersion were 6.93 and 7.4, respectively, both higher than 6.5. This indicates that the induced psychological intervention effect of the gameplay virtual environment generated by point cloud 3D meets the design expectations. This helps to enhance the user's sense of experience and enhance the positive effect of psychological intervention.

AB This paper presents a systematic literature review investigating collaborative play for autistic children. Autistic children are often faced with challenges related to social interaction, communication, and interest during play. This underscores the importance of exploring collaborative play as a potential intervention. Collaborative play, where children engage together towards shared goals, offers promising prospects for improving communication abilities in autistic children. To conduct this review, four search engines were utilized, resulting in the identification of 2,452 articles. Through a systematic selection process, the initial pool was narrowed down to 74 articles for further examination, eventually focusing on 14 papers. The findings indicate that various resources and strategies can facilitate collaborative play among autistic children. The review discussed the technologies employed and emphasized the need for regular engagement in collaborative play for autistic children, with the presence of a mediator - often parents or teachers - to support the different actions. The studies highlighted the inclusive environments, where autistic children play alongside their neurotypical peers, fostering social development can be of support. This review sheds light on the critical aspects of collaborative play that have not been adequately studied, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

AB The application of games in the field of education has brought new developments and updated educational needs to games. To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%. The experimental data demonstrates the high applicability of this research method and also achieves the goal of game design, which has certain practical teaching application value.

AB Due to the international prominence that eSports are acquiring, it is necessary to study their effects on human behavior. Specifically, the difference between the motor skills of players with different levels of experience. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to observe whether there are differences in hand accelerations (mouse handling) and digital reaction time between different skill levels. 21 subjects participated and were grouped according to their skill level (Low, Intermediate and Elite levels). The results showed greater hand accelerations in the Elite and Intermediate Skills players than Low-Skill players (p < 0.05). The hand-eye reaction time was lower in the Elite-Skill group than in the Low-Skill group (p = 0.008). Those with a Low-Skill had a higher dots per inch (DPI) than those with Intermediate and Elite Skills (p < 0.05). Elite-Skill players used larger screens than Low-Skill players (p = 0.034). The results suggest that players with better skills have better hand acceleration and shorter hand-eye reaction time.

AB For different entertainment robot tasks and action requirements, this article adopts multiple control algorithms and optimizes the algorithms. There are certain errors in the movement and interaction process of entertainment robots, which can affect the control effect and user experience of the robots. Therefore, the study models and analyzes the errors of robots by establishing error models, and proposes corresponding correction strategies to correct the errors, thereby improving the control accuracy and reliability of entertainment robots. In terms of identifying and alleviating student stress emotions, multimodal fusion comprehensively utilizes multiple sensors and data sources to obtain emotional information of students, more accurately identifying and understanding their stress emotions. Based on these analysis results, entertainment robots can adopt corresponding relief strategies to help students alleviate stress emotions. By comparing the changes in stress emotions and student feedback before and after the experiment, entertainment robots based on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence have potential application value in the process of student stress emotion recognition. The remote control system and optimized control effect of robots provide flexibility and efficiency for robot operation. The evaluation results of stress relief effect show that entertainment robots have a positive impact on the relief of student stress emotions.

AB Economic law is closely related to people's daily social life, which can protect and supervise people's daily and economic behavior, and has fairness and justice. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have significantly developed in the field of economic law. By utilizing this algorithm, not only can we effectively solve relevant problems in economic law, but we can also further optimize economic law efficiently. Based on this, we introduced the algorithm into search decision-making in artificial intelligence and successfully constructed an optimization model for economic law. Firstly, this article analyzes the semi supervised clustering algorithms in deep learning and proposes a learning model for comparing the algorithms. After optimization, a heuristic search algorithm with good performance was obtained. We will design the artificial intelligence search decision technology based on deep learning algorithms into the economic and legal model to obtain the final optimization model. A comparative experiment was conducted on the dataset, and the results showed that the optimization model constructed in this article provides certain assistance for the improvement of China's economic and legal system.

AB As Esports grows rapidly, it is imperative to understand cyberbullying in the professional video game playing context, including those who are most vulnerable to cyberbullying. It is predicted that professional women players would experience more cyberbullying and consequently have adverse effects on their mental health. Participants (N = 145) were collected from around the world (n = 14 countries) and completed a 10-minute online survey. Path analysis demonstrated that being a woman is a significant predictor of a particular type of cyberbullying (sexual harassment) which in turn also predicts mental health outcomes. Further, the degree to which a player treats gaming as a job (i.e., level of gaming professionalism) is a significant predictor of overall cyberbullying, and that cyberbullying subsequently predicts mental health outcomes. This study suggests the virtual workplace for professional players is unsafe, and further research is required to better understand how to protect these vulnerable workers from harm.

AB The potential of gamified learning as an emerging force for educational change has been widely recognized, to address the design deficiencies in the automatic recognition methods in traditional gamified learning models and the low accuracy of learning behavior recognition. Based on the improved gamified learning model, this paper jointly proposes an optimal design and recognition model of learning mode based on a deformable convolutional type network. Based on the gamified machine learning theory and interactive feedback theory, it comprehensively analyzes the procedural improvement of the gamified interactive intelligence model to provide a theoretical and practical basis for carrying out the analysis of the interactive impact and student behavior of teaching online courses based on gamified learning. The research results show that: (1) with the increase of the number of gamified learning samples, the value of iterative loss function decreases, the accuracy of recognition improves, and gradually converges and tends to be stable when the number of training times is 500; the 800 training samples setting can fully meet the network training requirements. (2) The deformable convolutional neural learning network constructed with the proposed joint algorithm reduces the network error during the training process and introduces the radical change function to improve the data processing capability. This improved gamified learning model is not only superior in recognition accuracy but also shows great advantages in recognition time.
