AB We propose a hardware technique for cache coherence over the existing approaches that ensure that shared and less frequently used cache blocks bypass private caches of multiple cores. Furthermore, this manuscript proposes a mechanism to tune the aggressiveness of a data prefetcher. Increased cache hit rate and improved performance have been observed since coherence management and prefetching delays are avoided using the proposed bypassing and thread progress-aware prefetch controlling mechanism. Our approach shows around 19% improvement in cache hit rate and 29% average performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art techniques for Parsec & Splash-2 multithreaded benchmarks.

TI A Quantitative Analysis and Optimization on the Cache Behavior
   Influenced by Literal Pools
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Cache; compiler; literal pool; RISC processor
AB A literal pool is normally used by a RISC processor to store constant values adjacent to the function that accesses them. Therefore, during a cache line filling, the literals in literal pools are possibly filled into the instruction cache, while instructions near literal pools could also be fetched into the data cache because the smallest cache management granularity is the size of a cache line. This useless but cached data deteriorates the performance of caches in a RISC processor. In this letter, we propose a find literal pool (FLP) algorithm to locate and record all literal pools in the text segment. Based on this information, we analyze the distribution of literal pools in SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks and trace the process of caching literals to quantify the impacts of literal pools on caches. To optimize the cache performance influenced by literal pools, a relocate literal pool (RLP) algorithm is proposed to merge originally scattered literal pools into bigger ones without any hardware overhead. We evaluate the effectiveness of RLP with six SPEC 2006 benchmarks. Experimental results show that RLP reduces cache misses up to 24.4% in I-Cache and 38.72% in D-Cache compared to those of original literal pool layouts.

AB Due to their importance in modern critical infrastructure, industrial environments, and military platforms, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) must be protected from cyberattacks. This letter presents a quad-redundant architecture for PLCs to achieve cyber-resilience against hacking. Typical redundancy schemes for PLCs provide robustness against physical damage and random faults, but exhibit severe vulnerabilities to software hijacking and other cyberattacks. The proposed quad-redundant architecture combines software diversification and hardware redundancy to harden PLCs and provide high-assurance protection against software hijacking, and improves cyber-resilience by securely regenerating PLC instances that succumb to cyberattacks. A chilled-water system and memory corruption attack scenario are simulated with control hardware-in-the-loop to evaluate the cyber-resilience achieved by the proposed architecture and demonstrate successful recovery from cyberattacks. Results show that the proposed architecture can successfully detect, thwart, and recover from software hijacking cyberattacks that would otherwise be extremely difficult to detect.

ID VERIFICATION
AB Cross-layer runtime management (RTM) frameworks for embedded systems provide a set of standard application programming interfaces (APIs) for communication between different system layers (i.e., RTM, applications, and device) and simplify the development process by abstracting these layers. Integration of independently developed components of the system is an error-prone process that requires careful verification. In this letter, we propose a formal approach to integration testing through automatic generation of runtime assertions in order to test the implementation of the APIs. Our approach involves a formal model of the APIs developed using the Event-B formal method, which is automatically translated to a set of assertions and embedded in the existing implementation of APIs. The embedded assertions are used at runtime to check the correctness of the integration.

AB Cyber physical systems (CPSs) will be deployed for decades, thus they should be secure against long-term attacks. Most CPSs adopt the datagram transport layer security (DTLS), as the de facto security protocol. By using public key cryptography (PKC) based on traditional RSA or elliptic-curves, DTLS establishes secured communication channels between multiple parties. However, the foreseeable breakthrough of quantum computers represents a risk for many PKC ecosystems. Traditional PKC will no be longer considered secure. Therefore, the integration of post-quantum security is mandatory. Due to their limited resources, tight performance requirements, and long-term life-cycles, this is especially challenging for CPSs. In this letter we propose, implement and evaluate for the first time a post-quantum enhanced DTLS, able to establish secure communications of CPSs, even in the presence of quantum computers. An NTRU post-quantum solution was used to perform the key transport among the CPSs entities. We show that is feasible to integrate our post-quantum enhanced DTLS, together with the full Internet engineering task force protocol stack in highly constrained environments, such as the CPSs.

AB Hotspots occur frequently in 3-Dmulticore processors (3D-MCPs) and they may adversely impact the reliability of the system and its lifetime. We present support-vector-machine (SVM)-based dynamic voltage assignment (SVMDVA) strategy to select voltages among low-power and high-performance operating modes for reducing hotspots and optimizing performance in 3D-MCPs. The proposed SVMDVA can be employed in online, thermally constrained task schedulers. First, we revealed two different thermal regions of 3D-MCPs and extract different key features of these regions. Based on these key features, SVM models are constructed to predict the thermal behavior and the best operation mode of 3D-MCPs during runtime. SVMDVA using SVM models with monitoring workload and temperature behavior can effectively limit the temperature increase in 3D-MCPs. This is extremely important for accurately predicting the thermal behavior and providing the optimum operating condition of 3D-MCPs to achieve the best system performance. Experimental results show that SVMDVA is an effective technique for reducing hotspot occurrences (57.19%) and increasing throughput (25.41%) for 3D-MCPs.

Our SAM hierarchy overcomes the coherence overhead and inflexibility of purely hardware-managed memory hierarchies in adapting to variable workloads. Our preliminary results show opportunities for energy saving and performance improvement through: 1) a hybrid software-programmable memory (SPM)/cache local memory adaptable to the application's memory characteristics; 2) SPM-based management of shared data; and 3) virtualizing and sharing the on-chip memory space between concurrently running applications. Primary experimental results show opportunities to reduce the execution time and the memory hierarchy energy consumption by up to 23% and 7%, respectively, depending on the workload.

TI Open Challenges for Probabilistic Measurement-Based Worst-Case Execution
   Time

AB The worst-case execution time (WCET) is a critical parameter describing the largest value for the execution time of programs. Even though such a parameter is very hard to attain, it is essential as part of guaranteeing a real-time system meets its timing requirements. The complexity of modern hardware has increased the challenges of statically analyzing the WCET and reduced the reliability of purely measuring the WCET. This has led to the emergence of probabilistic WCETs (pWCETs) analysis as a viable technique. The low probability of appearance of large execution times of a program has motivated the utilization of rare events theory like extreme value theory (EVT). As pWCET estimation based on EVT has matured as a discipline, a number of open challenges have become apparent when applying the existing approaches. This letter enumerates key challenges while establishing a state of the art of EVT-based pWCET estimation methods.

AB Adaptive system has become a popular approach to mitigate dynamic variations with the help of monitoring and actuation. However, design margin is still required due to imperfections in the entire adaptation process, including inaccuracy and latency for both monitors and actuators. In this letter, we study the system-level margining problem in presence of monitoring and actuation. We first analyze the margining strategies for different types of dynamic variation sources. Case studies are performed with different monitor and actuator types for temperature variations. Our experiment results show that inappropriate design and selection of monitor and actuator can result in up to 2.8X more system margin. Based on the results, some design guidelines are given for system design optimization.

TI Implicit Programming: A Fast Programming Strategy for NAND Flash Memory

ID METADATA
AB The aggressive shrinking of process geometry and an increase in the number of bits stored in each memory cell of NAND flash memory inevitably degrade the reliability of NAND flash. Redundancy methods have been widely adopted to enhance the reliability of the system data in NAND flash memory. However, the redundancy process will induce extra program operations which will sharply degrade the I/O performance of the system. This letter presents implicit programming strategy, a fast redundancy strategy for NAND flash memory storage systems adopting redundancy methods. Our technique for the first time exploits the property of the copyback operation and combines the normal program operation and copyback program operation to reduce the I/O performance overhead induced by the redundancy process. We have implemented implicit programming on a real hardware platform. The experimental results shoChang-DAC09w that by combining with implicit programming, one redundancy scheme (Meta-Cure) can reduce up to 27.24% of the I/O performance overhead.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
AB Although research has shown vulnerabilities and shortcomings of the controller area network bus (CAN bus) and proposed alternatives, the CAN bus protocol is still the industry standard and present in most vehicles. Due to its vulnerability to potential intruders that can hinder execution or even take control of the vehicles, much work has focused on detecting intrusions on the CAN bus. However, most literature does not provide mechanisms to reason about, or respond to the attacks so that the system can continue to execute safely despite the intruder. This letter proposes a low-overhead methodology to automatically classify intrusions into predefined types once detected. Our framework: 1) groups messages of the same attacks into blocks; 2) extracts relevant features from each block; and 3) predicts the type of attack using a lightweight classifier model. The initial models depicted in this letter show an accuracy of up to 99.16% within the first 50 ms of the attack, allowing the system to quickly react to the intrusion before the malicious actor can conclude their attack. We believe this letter lays the groundwork for vehicles to have specialized runtime reactions based on the attack type.

TI Effects of Runtime Reconfiguration on PUFs Implemented as FPGA-Based
   Accelerators
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Hardware security; reconfigurable hardware; security primitives
AB Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are a handy security primitive for resource-constrained devices. They offer an alternative to the resource-intensive classical hash algorithms. Using the IC differences resulting from the fabrication process, PUFs give device-specific outputs (responses) when given the same inputs (challenges). Hence, without using a device-specific key, PUFs can generate device-specific responses. FPGAs are one of the platforms that are heavily studied as a candidate for PUF implementation. The idea is that a PUF that is designed as an HDL code can be used as part of the static design or as a dynamic accelerator. Previous works studied PUF implementation as part of the static design. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, this letter studies PUFs when used as runtime reconfigurable accelerators. In this letter, we find that not all regions of an FPGA are equally suitable for implementing different PUF types. Regions, where clock routing resources exist, are the worst suited for PUF implementation. Moreover, we find out that for certain PUF types, the property of dynamic partial reconfiguration can lead to performance degradation if not applied carefully. When static routing passing through the region increases, the PUF performance degrades significantly.

AB The malicious acoustic attack can easily cause the failure of micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. It can use ultrasonic waves to attack the MEMS gyroscope over long distances. This type of attack is highly hidden and harmful. Therefore, the purpose of this letter is to locate malicious sources and facilitate the eradication of the threat. We designed a prototype system to simulate an ultrasonic attack on an MEMS gyroscope, which can collect and analyze the state of the gyroscope after being attacked. Furthermore, we proposed sigma-standard deviation-based feature extraction, and then designed a neural-network-based traceability location method to seek for attacker's location. The experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively and accurately locate the malicious acoustic source location.

AB Application-aware oblivious routing that supports flow-specific routing and static virtual channel (VC) assignments can achieve better performance than conventional oblivious routing by accounting for traffic demands of various flows in a given application. However, because these prior approaches consider the application-aware routing and static VC assignment steps separately, they unnecessarily impose routing restrictions to avoid deadlocks. In this letter, we propose a joint application-aware oblivious routing and static VC allocation framework that optimally solves both problems together to enable better deadlock-free performance. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve up to 30% better performance than the state-of-the-art application-aware oblivious routing algorithms and substantially better still in comparison with conventional oblivious routing approaches.

TI IDRA: An In-Storage Data Reorganization Accelerator for Multidimensional
   Databases
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Data reorganization; in-storage accelerator; multidimensional database;
   storage method
AB In the multidimensional databases, various storage methods for the main memory have been proposed for efficient data processing. On the other hand, storage devices such as SSD still leverage the conventional row-oriented storage method to avoid complicated operating system modification. Since there is a difference in storage methods between the main memory and storage device, it is necessary to reorganize the data between them. However, data reorganization in the conventional CPU-based systems causes a long latency due to a large number of memory accesses. In addition, it also causes high dynamic power consumption of a CPU. In this letter, we propose an in-storage data reorganization accelerator for multidimensional databases (IDRA). We place the IDRA in an SSD to reorganize data on the fly while loading it into the main memory without intervention of the CPU. In our evaluation on the off-the-shelf system (not simulation), the IDRA-based system improves the performance by 78.6% and reduces the system-wide energy by 30.3%, on average, compared to the conventional CPU-based system.

AB Hardware Trojan detection on modern integrated circuits (ICs) is a challenging task since the inspector may have no idea about the location and size of the embedded Trojan circuit. To achieve an accurate Trojan detection, instead of relying on hardware reverse engineering, a nondestructive technique based on thermal maps and inception neural networks (INNs) is proposed in this letter. The thermal maps generated by a Trojan-free (TF) IC chip and multiple emulated Trojan-infected (TI) IC chips are collected and optimized as the critical side-channel leakages at first. Then, INNs are utilized to analyze these optimized thermal maps to exactly extract the information of the embedded Trojans under the assistance of customized filters. As shown in the results, after training the INNs with 150 000 thermal maps, the corresponding Trojan detection accuracy can be achieved over 98.2%.

AB Applicable in different fields and markets, low energy high efficiency video coding (HEVC) codecs and their constituting elements have been heavily studied. Fractional pixel interpolation is one of its most costly blocks. In this letter, a field programmable gate array implementation of HEVC fractional pixel interpolation, outperforming literature solutions, is proposed. Approximate computing, in conjunction with hardware reconfiguration, guarantees a tunable interpolation system offering an energy versus quality tradeoff to further reduce energy.

AB Skill assessment is fundamental to enhance current laparoscopic surgical training and reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries from performing these procedures. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to improve human posture and surgeons' skills training. While they work well in the lab, they normally require significant computational power which makes it impossible to use them on edge devices. This letter presents two low memory footprint DNN models used for classifying laparoscopic surgical skill levels at the edge. Trained models were deployed on three Arm Cortex-M processors using the X-Cube-AI and Tensorflow Lite Micro (TFLM) libraries. Results show that the CUBE-AI-based models give the best relative performance, memory footprint, and accuracy tradeoffs when executed on the Cortex-M7.

TI Fast and High-Accuracy Approximate MAC Unit Design for CNN Computing
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Approximate computing; convolution neural network; multiply and

ID COMPRESSORS
AB Multiply and accumulate (MAC) composed of a set of multipliers and one reduction dominates the latency and power of convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators. Existing approximate multipliers reduce latency and power at a tolerable drop in accuracy, without considering the data distribution (implicitly assuming that data are uniformly distributed). This letter discloses that practical CNNs' activations and weights are usually Gaussian-like distributed, and the bits of quantized activations and weights are typically not with a probability of 0.5. Thus, we propose an approximate MAC unit design by taking into account the statistical features of input data, to achieve a balanced tradeoff among latency, power, and accuracy. The extensive experiments show that our proposed MAC unit design provides much higher accuracy than state-of-the-art approximate circuits, while the latency, area, and power are similar.

AB Memory security has recently come into the spotlight as attackers have stepped up their efforts to gain illicit access to sensitive data or cause denial-of-memory service via a variety of avenues, such as cold boot attacks, bus snooping, and physical probing or tampering. In this letter, we propose SuperVAULT, a novel secure storage solution for protecting secret data/keys by exploiting the superparamagnetic regime of nanomagnets. Through materials and dimensional engineering of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) free layer, the energy barrier of spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random-access memory (STT-MRAM) cells can be designed to lie in the range of the thermal energy (k(B)T). Such superparamagnetic MTJ (s-MTJ) cells, with an O(10 ns) retention time, need to be refreshed frequently. In the absence of data refresh (under attack conditions), the data they hold is thermally corrupted to a random state after an arbitrary but short amount of time. We leverage this property to devise a secure memory primitive and showcase its potential against cold boot and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks. Further, the overheads for s-MTJ-based STT-MRAMs are shown to be promising for on-chip implementations.

AB Polar codes are one of the recently developed error correcting codes, and they are popular due to their capacity achieving nature. The architecture of the successive cancellation (SC) decoder algorithm is composed of a recursive processing element (PE). The PE comprises various blocks that include signed adder, subtractor, comparator, multiplexers, and few logic gates. Therefore, the latency of the PE is a primary concern. Hence, a high-speed architecture for implementing the SC decoding algorithm for polar codes is proposed. In the proposed work, a novel restructuring of the 2bit-SC (2b-SC) precomputation decoder architecture is carried out to reduce the latency by 20% while reducing the hardware complexity. Compared to the 2b-SC precomputation decoder, the proposed architecture also has 19% increased throughput for (1024, 512) polar codes with 45% reduction in the gate count.

AB In this letter, we propose a multivariate time-series classification system that fuses multirate sensor measurements within the latent space of a deep neural network. In our network, the system identifies the surface category based on audio and inertial measurements generated from the surface impact, each of which has a different sampling rate and resolution in nature. We investigate the feasibility of categorizing ten different everyday surfaces using a proposed convolutional neural network, which is trained in an end-to-end manner. To validate our approach, we developed an embedded system and collected 60 000 data samples under a variety of conditions. The experimental results obtained exhibit a test accuracy for a blind test dataset of 93%, taking less than 300 ms for end-to-end classification in an embedded machine environment. We conclude this letter with a discussion of the results and future direction of research.

AB The shift from homogeneous multicore to heterogeneous multicore introduces challenges in scheduling the tasks to the appropriate cores maintaining the time deadline. This letter studies the existing scheduling schemes in a heterogeneous multicore system and finds an approach to enhance the homogeneous system model to heterogeneous scheduling architecture. The proposed model increases the overall system utilization by accommodating almost all the tasks (low power task and high power task) into appropriate cores (big high power and small low power). It further enhances the system performance by allocating rejected jobs from small cores into the big cores through a dispatcher.

DT Article
DE Approximate adders; approximate computing; arithmetic error rate (ARE)
AB In this letter, we present a novel methodology to calculate the arithmetic error rate (AER) for deterministic approximate adder architectures, where the calculation of each output bit is restricted to a subset of the input bits, denoted as visibilities. Such architectures have been widely proposed in the literature and are, e.g., obtained when splitting the carry chain in a carry-propagate adder into partitions each computed by a separate parallel adder, or when removing carry-lookahead operators in a parallel prefix adder. Our contribution is a unified calculus for determining the ARE for: 1) such deterministic approximate adder architectures making use of visibilities and 2) the general case of arbitrarily (also nonuniformly) distributed input bits.

AB We present a requirements-driven methodology enabling efficient runtime monitoring of embedded systems. The proposed approach extracts a runtime monitoring graph from system requirements specified using unified modeling language sequence diagrams with timing annotations. Nonintrusive, in-situ, on-chip hardware dynamically monitors the system execution, matches the specified requirements, and provides detailed information that can be analyzed in the event of a system failure. We present a case study using an autonomous vehicle subsystem demonstrating that the approach can achieve 100% detection rate of common failure types, including timing, dependency, synchronization, and sensor failures. We further analyze the relationship between coverage of system events, detection rates, and hardware requirements.

AB This work proposes a new paradigm for contactless vital sign sensing that adopts an integrated ultrawideband (UWB) radar and hybrid optical wireless communication (OWC) technologies. The proposed system is composed of a sensor node and a receiver node. The sensor node is responsible for detecting continuous vital sign signals and then transmitting these signals via the hybrid OWC transmitters, which are composed of a visible light communication transmitter and an infrared transmitter. The contactless UWB radar adopts low intermedium frequency demodulation rather than the conventional direct down conversion topology to avoid severe direct current (DC) offset issue. The advantages of this merged configuration do not only help reduce radar complexity but also provide the required modulated signal with vital signs for the subsequent OWC system. Moreover, the receiver node has an OWC receiver module for receiving vital signs that utilizes a photodiode-based receiver with an analog filter and digital signal processing mechanisms. The proposed architecture exhibits the potential to reduce radar complexity and provide new solutions to replace the conventional contact sensing system used in hospitals or nursing homes.

AB This letter presents a technique for nonintrusive code execution tracking using side-channel signals of power consumption. Using a nearest-neighbor classifier that integrates the dynamic time warping distance with information from the control flow graph, it is possible to identify executed basic blocks from a trace of power consumption that exhibits temporal distortions due to assembly-level artifacts and varying operational conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves over 95% precision when inferring the runtime execution flow of a cruise control application using unmarked traces of power consumption collected from different processors.

AB Sensors with digital outputs require software conversion routines to transform the unitless analog-to-digital converter samples to physical quantities with correct units. These conversion routines are computationally complex given the limited computational resources of low-power embedded systems. This letter presents a set of machine learning methods to learn new, less-complex conversion routines that do not sacrifice accuracy for the BME680 environmental sensor. We present a Pareto analysis of the tradeoff between accuracy and computational overhead for the models and models that reduce the computational overhead of the existing industry-standard conversion routines for temperature, pressure, and humidity by 62%, 71%, and 18%, respectively. The corresponding RMS errors are 0.0114 degrees C, 0.0280 KPa, and 0.0337%. These results show that machine learning methods for learning conversion routines can produce conversion routines with a reduced computational overhead which maintain good accuracy.

AB The NEURAGHE architecture has proved to be a powerful accelerator for deep convolutional neural networks running on heterogeneous architectures based on Xilinx Zynq-7000 all programmable system-on-chips. NEURAGHE exploits the processing system and the programmable logic available in these devices to improve performance through parallelism, and to widen the scope of use-cases that can be supported. In this letter, we extend the NEURAghe template-based architecture to guarantee design-time scalability to multiprocessor SoCs with vastly different cost, size, and power envelope, such as Xilinx's Z-7007s, Z-7020, and Z-7045. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance and cost effectiveness in all the analyzed configurations, reaching up to 335 GOps/s on the Z-7045.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) connects many tiny low-cost devices, so-called IoT nodes. Designers need to implement smart functionality with highly limited resources in terms of design effort, available on-chip memory, and computation power. This letter proposes a new method to reduce memory size, performance, and development effort for the device drivers. The driver behavior is developed with a new C-like domain-specific language. Through register layout optimization targeting to combine accesses it achieves to reduce run time by 52% and code size by 22% for two RISC-V PULPino device drivers.

AB Binary content-addressable memory (BiCAM) is a popular high speed search engine in hardware, which provides output typically in one clock cycle. But speed of CAM comes at the cost of various disadvantages, such as high latency, low storage density, and low architectural scalability. In addition, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are used in many applications because of its advantages, do not have hard IPs for CAM. Since FPGAs have embedded IPs for random-access memories (RAMs), several RAM-based CAM architectures on FPGAs are available in the literature. However, these architectures are especially targeted for ternary CAMs, not for BiCAMs; thus, the available RAM-based CAMs may not be fully beneficial for BiCAMs in terms of architectural design. Since modern FPGAs are enriched with logical resources, why not to configure them to design BiCAM on FPGA? This letter presents a logic-based high performance BiCAM architecture (LH-CAM) using Xilinx FPGA. The proposed CAM is composed of CAM words and associated comparators. A sample of LH-CAM of size 64 x 36 is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. Compared with the latest prior work, the proposed CAM is much simpler in architecture, storage efficient, reduces power consumption by 40.92%, and improves speed by 27.34%.

AB The IEEE 1666-2011 standard defines SystemC based on traditional discrete event simulation (DES) and sequential co-routine semantics, despite explicit parallelism in the model and ample parallel processor cores available in today's host computers. In order to evolve the SystemC standard toward faster parallel DES, substantial hurdles must be overcome. This letter identifies seven obstacles in the standard that stand in the way of efficient parallel SystemC simulation, namely the co-routine semantics, simulator state, lack of thread safety, the role of channels, TLM-2.0, sequential mindset, and temporal decoupling. For each obstacle, we discuss the problem and propose a potential solution toward truly parallel SystemC. This letter to the editor is meant to identify difficulties with IEEE SystemC and stimulate fruitful discussion in the community.

TI An Approximate Parallel Annealing Ising Machine for Solving Traveling

   traveling salesman problem (TSP)
AB Annealing-based Ising machines have emerged as high-performance solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). As a typical COP with constraints imposed on the solution, traveling salesman problems (TSPs) are difficult to solve using conventional methods. To address this challenge, we design an approximate parallel annealing Ising machine (APAIM) based on an improved parallel annealing algorithm. In this design, adders are reused in the local field accumulator units (LAUs) with half-precision floating-point representation of the coefficients in the Ising model. The momentum scaling factor is approximated by a linear, incremental function to save hardware. To improve the solution quality, a buffer-based energy calculation unit selects the best solution among the found candidate results in multiple iterations. Finally, approximate adders are applied in the design for improving the speed of accumulation in the LAUs. The design and synthesis of a 64-spin APAIM show the potential of this methodology in efficiently solving complicated constrained COPs.

AB Operating at reduced voltage is an effective technique for improving the energy efficiency of computing. However, the approach is constrained by its exacerbated sensitivity to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, which under throughput constraints challenges finding the energy minimizing voltage-frequency operating point. Commonly utilized design approaches for adaptive voltage scaling are based on timing slack measurement or speculation techniques that require adding extra hardware, e.g., error detection sequence (EDS) circuits, that substantially increase the design complexity, and are not applicable for already fabricated designs. In this letter, instead of circuitlevel techniques, a low-cost algorithmic error detection method is proposed as the enabler for reduced voltage operation of fast Fourier transform (FFT) accelerators. Without requiring neither gate-level nor circuit-level modifications, the method works based on an intrinsic property of the Fourier transform, i.e., Parseval's identity. The method is demonstrated on a system-on-chip (SoC) that integrates a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) made to operate at reduced voltages. The fault detection capability is profiled using the demonstration test bench, implemented both as software and as hardware. In the experiments, a approximate to 43% reduction in power consumption was achieved without sacrificing the throughput and reliability. The overheads of the proposed fault detection approach scale sublinearly with respect to FFT size and are <= 10% for 1024-point FFT.

AB This letter presents a proposed embedded system for the simultaneous study of sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) and related cardiac arrhythmias, which can affect about 1 billion people worldwide. Its objective is to become a tool to research the relational causes of these disruptions. It can record biomedical signals and vital parameters related to cardiac and respiratory activity commonly used in clinical practice. The system is designed to be used in sleep studies, providing greater comfort to users by integrating two devices into one. The proposed system is battery powered and has Bluetooth wireless communication for remote studies. The design is based on specific electronic components, such as analog front-end and system on chips, and best-practice guidelines for PCB design were followed. A hybrid-scheduler was selected as software architecture to ensure the task execution at specific intervals. The system's signal quality recording subsystem was tested using a multiparametric simulator, commercial Holter device, and acquired real records. The results are similar to other works.

AB By means of a simple buffer design, we show that active versus passive and push versus pull settings in asynchronous communication protocols, also known as handshake protocols, can be controlled by initialization. We advocate postponing initialization until run time and show that postponement simplifies the design and design process and serves test, debug, and analysis. We design the buffer as a network of communication channels with storage, called Links, and storage-free computation modules, called Joints. We describe the behaviors of Links and Joints using a shared variable model presented here for the first time.

AB In this letter, we investigate the inherent vulnerability of register allocation (RA) in which the variables of a source program are mapped to the registers in hardware. This letter makes three important contributions. Specifically, we show that RA is secure if there is no spilling. Next, we show that RA with spilling does not preserve the security properties of the source program. Our experimental evaluation using a wide variety of benchmarks demonstrates that RA in LLVM is not secure. Finally, we propose a secure RA in LLVM that will not introduce additional information leaks in the generated code due to spilling.

AB Traditional research on mobile malware detection has focused on approaches that rely on analyzing bytecode for uncovering malicious apps. Unfortunately, cybercriminals can bypass such methods by embedding malware directly in native machine code, making traditional methods inadequate. Another challenge that detection solutions face is scalability. The sheer number of malware released every year makes it difficult for solutions to efficiently scale their coverage. This letter presents an energy efficient solution that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to defend against malware. We show that systematically converting native instructions from Android apps into images using Hilbert space-filling curves and entropy visualization techniques enable CNNs to reliably detect malicious apps with near ideal accuracy. We characterize popular CNN architectures that have been known to perform well on different computer vision tasks and evaluate their effectiveness against malware using an Android malware dataset.

   arithmetic; field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); multiplying circuits
AB Multiplication is one of the most extensively used arithmetic operations in a wide range of applications, such as multimedia processing and artificial neural networks. For such applications, multiplier is one of the major contributors to energy consumption, critical path delay, and resource utilization. These effects get more pronounced in field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based designs. However, most of the state-of-the-art designs are done for ASIC-based systems. Furthermore, a few field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based designs that exist are largely limited to unsigned numbers, which require extra circuits to support signed operations. To overcome these limitations for the FPGA-based implementations of applications utilizing signed numbers, this letter presents an area-optimized, low-latency, and energy-efficient architecture for an accurate signed multiplier. Compared to the Vivado area-optimized multiplier IP, our implementations offer up to 40.0%, 43.0%, and 70.0% reduction in terms of area, latency, and energy, respectively. The RTL implementations of our designs will be released as an open-source library at https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-downloads.

AB Precise execution time profiles (ETPs) are an extremely helpful instrument to assist software and system designers in analyzing the performance and timing behavior of embedded systems. Previously, we have presented an approach that exploits embedded trace units of modern system-on-chip. It allows us to compute execution time histograms during the runtime of the system under test (SuT). These histograms can easily be converted into ETPs. In this contribution, we show an extended version of this method that uses the information gathered in previous runs of the SuT to refine the binning used for the collection of the histograms. We show that these improved histograms deliver much more insight.

DE Approximate computing; approximate system
AB Approximate computing is a new design paradigm that exploits the intrinsic error resilience exhibited by emerging applications to significantly improve their energy efficiency and performance. Prior work in this domain has proposed approximation techniques targeting either the computational subsystem or the memory subsystem. For the first time, this letter proposes a methodology to perform synergistic approximations across the computation and memory subsystems together that results in a significant improvement in energy consumption compared to the case when the subsystems are approximated independently. We implemented our proposed methodology using an Altera Stratix IV GX FPGA based Terasic TR4-230 development board containing a 1GB DDR3 DRAM module, which executes three error- resilient benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate energy improvements in the range of 2.05 x -4.45 x for minimal loss in application quality (< 1%). Compared to individual approximations, our technique achieves an additional 1.6 x -2.35x energy savings for the same quality specifications.

AB Stochastic computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm that offers hardware-efficient solutions for developing low-cost and noise-robust architectures. In SC, deterministic logic systems are employed along with bit-stream sources to process scalar values. However, using long bit-streams introduces challenges, such as increased latency and significant energy consumption. To address these issues, we present an optimization-oriented approach for modeling and sizing new logic gates, which results in optimal latency. The optimization process is automated using hardware-software cooperation by integrating Cadence and MATLAB environments. Initially, we optimize the circuit topology by leveraging the design parameters of two-input basic logic gates. This optimization is performed using a multiobjective approach based on a deep neural network. Subsequently, we employ the proposed gates to demonstrate favorable solutions targeting SC-based operations.

AB Transformer models are continuously achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks. To meet demanding performance targets, the number of model parameters is continuously increased. As a result, state-of-the-art Transformers require substantial computational resources prohibiting their deployment on consumer-grade hardware. In the literature, overparameterized Transformers are successfully reduced in size with the help of pruning strategies. Existing works lack the ability to optimize the full architecture, without incurring significant overheads, in a fully differentiable manner. Our work proposes a single-stage approach for training a Transformer for memory-efficient inference and various resource-constrained scenarios. Transformer blocks are extended with trainable gate parameters, which attribute importance and control information flow. Their integration into a differentiable pruning-aware training scheme allows the extraction of extremely sparse subnetworks at runtime, with minimal performance degradation. Evaluative pruning results, at the attention head and layer levels, illustrate the memory efficiency of our trained subnetworks under various memory budgets.

AB Modern Internet of Things (IoT) end nodes must support computational intensive workloads at a limited power budget. Parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) architectures are a promising target for this scenario, and the availability of highly optimized software libraries is crucial to exploit parallelism and reduce software development costs. This letter proposes an efficient parallel design of the widely used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) transforms targeting ultra-low-power IoT devices. We address key performance challenges related to fine-grained synchronization and banking conflicts in shared memory. We achieve high throughput (50.95 samples/mu s, on average), good parallel speedup (up to 6.79x), and high energy efficiency (up to 172.55 GOp/s/W) on a cluster of eight RISC-V cores optimized for PULP operation.

AB Approximate computing (AC) is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient computation. The basic idea of AC is to sacrifice high precision for low energy by allowing hardware to carry out "approximately correct" calculations. This provides a major challenge for software quality assurance: programs successfully verified to be correct might be erroneous on approximate hardware. In this letter, we present a novel approach for determining under what conditions a software verification result is valid for approximate hardware. To this end, we compute the allowed tolerances for AC hardware from successful verification runs. More precisely, we derive a set of constraints whichwhen met by the AC hardware-guarantees the verification result to carry over to AC. On the practical side, we furthermore: 1) show how to extract tolerances from verification runs employing predicate abstraction as verification technology and 2) show how to check such constraints on hardware designs. We have implemented all techniques, and exemplify them on example C programs and a number of recently proposed approximate adders.

AB A large fraction of bugs discovered in the design flow of embedded control software (ECS) arises from the control software's interaction with the plant it controls. Traditional formal analysis approaches using interleaved controller-plant reach-set analysis grossly overapproximate the reachable states and does not scale. In this letter, we examine a verification approach that considers a control system with the (possibly nonlinear) plant dynamics and mode switches specified along with the actual control software implementation. Given this input, we generate a bounded-time safety verification problem encoded as satisfiability modulo theories (SMTs) constraints. We leverage delta-decidability over Reals to achieve scalability while verifying the control software.

AB The exact response time analysis for fixed priority scheduling (FPS) in the lowest priority first-based feasibility tests is commonly required as a part of system design tools. This letter proposes an efficient method for this, which we named incremental lower bound (ILB) calculation method. Compared to the best algorithm that has been known so far, which is the incremental calculation method, ILB reduces the feasibility test iterations/run times by more than 38% and 20% regardless of varying utilization and the number of tasks in task sets.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly being used within safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It is important to validate both the timing and functional correctness of these systems. However, most approaches in the literature consider guaranteeing only the functionality of the ANN-based controllers. This issue stems largely from the implementation strategies used within common neural network frameworks-their underlying source code is often simply unsuitable for formal techniques such as static timing analysis. As a result, developers of safety-critical CPS must rely on informal techniques, such as measurement-based approaches, to prove correctness, techniques that provide weak guarantees at best. In this letter, we address this challenge. We propose a design pipeline whereby neural networks trained using the popular deep learning framework Keras are compiled to functionally equivalent C code. This C code is restricted to simple constructs that may be analyzed by the existing static timing analysis tools. As a result, if compiled to a suitable time-predictable platform, all execution bounds may be statically derived. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we execute an ANN trained to drive an autonomous vehicle around a race track. We compile the ANN to the Patmos time-predictable controller and show that we can derive the worst-case execution timings.

AB Due to the system-level power constraints, it is encountered that not all cores in a multicore chip can be simultaneously powered-on at the highest voltage/frequency levels. Also, in the future technology nodes, reliability issues due to the susceptibility of systems to transient faults should be considered in multicore platforms. Therefore, two major objectives in designing multicore embedded systems are low energy/power consumption and high reliability. This letter presents an energy management system that optimizes the energy consumption such that it satisfies reliability target and meets timing, thermal design power (TDP) and thermal safe power (TSP) constraints. Toward the TDP/TSP-constrained energy-reliability optimization, the proposed method schedules periodic real-time applications on different types of cores with voltage/frequency variations for heterogeneous multicore embedded systems. Experiments show that our proposed system provides up to 38.19% (in average by 29.66%) energy saving and up to 54.73% peak power reduction (in average by 24.55%) under different reliability targets and TDP/TSP constraints when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

TI Revisiting AES SBox Composite Field Implementations for FPGAs

DE Advanced encryption standard (AES) SBox; composite fields; field

AB Composite fields are used for implementing the advanced encryption standard (AES) SBox when compact and side-channel resistant constructions are required. The prior art has investigated efficient implementations of such SBoxes for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms. On field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); however, due to the considerably different structure compared with ASICs, these implementations perform poorly. In this letter, we revisit composite field AES SBox implementations for FPGAs. We show how design choices and optimizations can be made to better suit the granular look-up tables that are present in modern FPGAs. We investigate 2880 SBox constructions and show that about half of them are better than the state-of-the-art composite field implementation. Our best SBox implementation is 18% smaller compared with the state-of-the-art implementation on an FPGA.

TI HDGM: Hierarchical Dynamic Goal Management for Many-Core Resource
   Allocation
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Dark silicon; dynamic mapping; goal management (GM); lifetime balancing;
   many-cores; resource allocation
AB Many-core systems are highly complex and require thorough orchestration of different goals across the computing abstraction stack to satisfy embedded system constraints. Contemporary resource management approaches typically focus on a fixed objective, while neglecting the need for replanning (i.e., updating the objective function). This trend is particularly observable in existing resource allocation and application mapping approaches that allocate a task to a tile to maximize a fixed objective (e.g., the cores' and network's performance), while minimizing others (e.g., latency and power consumption). However, embedded system goals typically vary over time, and also over abstraction levels, requiring a new approach to orchestrate these varying goals. We motivate the problem by showcasing conflicts resulting from state-of-the-art fixed-objective resource allocation approaches, and highlight the need to incorporate dynamic goal management from the very early stages of design. We then present the concept of a hierarchical dynamic goal manager that considers the priority, significance, and constraints of each application, while holistically coupling the overlapping and/or contradicting goals of different applications to satisfy embedded system constraints.

DE Least-squares problems; matrix factorization; MIMO detection; QR
   decomposition; square-root computations
AB A square-root-free matrix QR decomposition (QRD) scheme, dubbed QDR decomposition (QDRD), was rederived by Ren et al. based on a scheme by Bjorck in order to simplify computations when solving least-squares (LS) problems on embedded systems. The QDRD scheme aims at eliminating both the square-root and division operations in the QRD normalization and backward substitution steps in LS computations. It is claimed by Ren et al. (F. Ren et al., IEEE Embedded Syst. Lett., vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 73-76) that the LS solution only requires finding the directions of the orthogonal basis of the matrix in question, regardless of the normalization of their Euclidean norms. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection problems have been named as potential applications that benefit from this. While this is true for unconstrained LS problems, we conversely show here that constrained LS problems such as MIMO detection still require computing the norms of the orthogonal basis to produce the correct result.

AB The use of embedded software is advancing in modern medical devices, so does its capabilities and complexity. This paradigm shift brings many challenges such as an increased rate of medical device failures due to software faults. In this letter, we present a rigorous "correct by construction" approach for the trustworthy development of hemodialysis machines, a subclass of active medical devices. We show how informal requirements of hemodialysis machines are modeled and analyzed through a rigorous process and suggest a generalization to a larger class of active medical devices.

AB The emerging nonvolatile memories (NVMs), such as spin transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) and racetrack memory (RTM), offer a promising solution to satisfy the memory and performance requirements of modern applications. Compared to the commonly utilized volatile static random-access memories (SRAMs), the NVMs provide better capacity and energy efficiency. However, many of these NVMs are still in the development phases and require proper evaluation in order to evaluate the impact of their use at the system level. Therefore, there is a need to design functional- and cycleaccurate simulators/emulators to evaluate the performance of these memory technologies. To this end, this work focuses on implementing a RISC-V-based emulation platform for evaluating NVMs. The proposed framework provides interfaces to integrate various types of NVMs, with RTMs and STT-RAMs used as test cases. The efficacy of the framework is evaluated by executing benchmark applications.

AB This work presents two codesign implementations of a true random number generation mechanism. Physical components provided by the programmable logic of FPGA are used for true random seed generation. The seed conditioning and generation of the large sequences were implemented using the block cipher Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implemented on the Cortex-A9 processor (embedded in the Zynq FPGA) or specific AESNI instructions in modern processors. Our implementations use less than 10% of the available resources on the target FPGAs and pass all the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests for random generators.

AB Decision tree for classification tasks are learned from the input dataset and consist of split nodes and leaf nodes. This letter presents the hardware implementation of learning of two means decision tree (TMDT). To accommodate large-size datasets and hence, to increase accuracy, the training data is divided into small batches and one batch at a time is loaded into chip memory. The hardware is divided into two pipelines to optimize timing and resource consumption. The critical path of the architecture enables the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to operate with maximum frequency of 62 MHz. Simulation results show that the proposed FPGA runs at least 27x and 26x faster than the C implementation and existing hardware, respectively.

AB Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a nanotechnology-based circuit design technology to design efficient circuits. Serial-parallel multiplier (SPM) is an efficient hardware circuit used in different applications ranging from simple arithmetic circuits, filters to complex cryptographic systems. In this work, an architecture that can be used for realizing SPM in QCA is discussed. Based on that architecture, an efficient 4-bit SPM is implemented in QCA. The proposed multiplier is also realized using efficient shift registers and adders. Parallel and serial shift registers are introduced in the circuit to store the inputs and outputs to increase the reliability of the circuit. The proposed work is the first of its kind to implement SPM with shift registers to store input and output in QCA. The proposed multiplier without shift registers is efficient and at least 66% faster compared to existing designs. The 4-bit multiplier with shift registers has 2271 cells covering an area of 7.74 mu m(2) with 25.25 clock cycle latency. To showcase, the scalability of a serial adder is also realized using the universal, scalable, and efficient clocking scheme.

AB The consultative committee for space data system (CCSDS)-123 is a standard for lossless compression of multispectral and hyperspectral images with applications in on-board power-constrained systems, such as satellites and military drones. This letter explores the low-power heterogeneous architecture of the Nvidia Jetson TX2 by proposing a parallel solution to the CCSDS-123 compressor on embedded systems, reducing development effort compared with the production of dedicated circuits, while maintaining low energy consumption. This solution parallelizes the predictor on a low-power graphics processing unit (GPU) while the encoders exploit the heterogeneous multiple cores of the CPUs and GPU concurrently. We report more than 16.6 Gb/s for the predictor and 1.4-Gb/s for the whole system, requiring less than 6.3 W and providing an efficiency of 245.6 Mb/s/W.

AB As interest in architectural designs for "Internet of Things (IoT) edge computing" is growing, conflicting requirements between energy-efficiency and design-productivity are becoming remarkably crucial. Owing to the increasing diversity of IoT applications, the domain-oriented designs of processors should be reassessed. By focusing on one application domain that is control-intensive and mainly operates "light" computations, we examine issues of current processor designs, present simple and energy-efficient processors, and justify the design strategies that we employed. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of our processors, in terms of circuit area and energy-efficiency, over ARM Cortex-M0, and reveals important findings in architectural designs for severely constrained IoT edge computing.

AB The demand of early estimation of the power of semiconductor devices has risen due to technology scaling, growing complexity, and faster time to market. In this letter, we present the early power estimation model for field programmable gate array-based designs. We perform the profiling at C-level using low-level virtual machine intermediate representation and then training of the neural network from the profiling information to create the estimation model. The model accuracy is validated from the CHStone, MachSuite, and Rosetta-master benchmark applications. An insignificant relative error of 0.21% to 5.12% is observed for the analyzed benchmark designs with the exceptional increase in estimation speed by 87 times of magnitude as compared to the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.

AB Approximate multiplication is a common operation used in approximate computing methods for high performance and low power computing. Power-efficient circuits for approximate multiplication can be realized with an approximate 4-2 compressor. This letter presents a novel design that uses a modification of a previous approximate 4-2 compressor design and adds an error recovery module. The proposed design, even with the additional error recovery module, is more accurate, requires less hardware, and consumes less power than previously proposed 4-2 compressor-based approximate multiplier designs.

AB A novel scheme for the introduction of chaos-based security into embedded systems at an architectural (hardware) level is presented in this letter. The logistic map is simplified for use in resource-constrained microcontrollers in the encryption of digital data through interface protocols like SPI etc. This letter, as an example, presents an outline of the registers and their associated logic for such an 8-bit chaotic modulator. Correlation analyses along with a Gottwald-Melbourne test proved its robustness for security. This letter develops a micro-architecture that involves the proposed chaos generator and discusses the control methods by which data is to be handled for seamless encryption/decryption without processor involvement. The descriptive work presented is proposed to be a silicon level encryption technique and its implications are generalized to be used with other word sizes and interface protocols, in any microcontroller.

AB Magnetic quantum-dot cellular automata (MQCA) is a recent technology in computation based on closely coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dots; it is favorable as the fabrication issues arise day by day at the nanometer scale in CMOS technology. In this letter, first, we propose an MQCA-based 2:1 Multiplexer (Mux) using conventional horizontal and vertical approaches. In the next step, we propose a novel area efficient compact design approach with the help of the explicit interaction, coupling concept, and dominant nature of slant edge nanomagnets. The proposed compact design methodology leads to similar to 71%-97% reduction in the total number of nanodots and similar to 22%-99% reduction in area occupancy compared to the horizontal, vertical, nanomagnetic QCA, and existing QCA-based 2:1 Mux. To showcase the scalability of our proposed structure, we also implement an 8:1 Mux. The design layouts and simulation results are verified using the MuMax3 micromagnetic simulator.

AB In the last 15 years, we have witnessed a neverending arm's race between the attacker and the defender with respect to cache-based side-channel attacks. We have seen a slew of attacks, countermeasures (CMs), counterattacks, counter-CMs, and so on. We analyze the evolution of this area, propose three necessary conditions for designing a successful CM, and then analyze timing and address-based CMs for popular algorithms, such as AES and PRESENT. We show that an optimal yet trivial solution for timing-based CMs is possible. Furthermore, addressbased CMs are inferior to timing-based CMs, and they can be broken in n(O(log(log(n)))) time.

TI FPGA Design of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) for Isomorphic

DE ELGamal; cryptography; isomorphic transformation; Koblitz curve
AB Attacking or tampering with sensitive data continues to increase risks to economic processes or human activities. These risks are significant key factors to improve the development and implementation of security systems. Therefore, improving cryptography is essentially needed to enhance the security of critical data. For example, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) over the Galois field GF(2163) is one of the public-key (asymmetric) cryptographic techniques, in which demands mapping a message (163-bit) to a point in the prime subgroup of the elliptic curve. To the best of our knowledge, mapping methods are not yet available on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Also, asymmetric encryption schemes often do not consider encrypting/decrypting data packets because of their computation complexity and performance limitations. In this letter, we propose and develop a concurrent reconfigurable cryptosystem to encrypt and decrypt stream of data using ECC on FPGA. First, we present hardware design and implementation to map a plain message on the elliptic curve based on isomorphic transformation, then second, we architect the elliptic curve ElGamal public-key encryption method by using point addition and multiplication on Koblitz elliptic curve on FPGA. Our proposed cryptosystem is synthesized and implemented on Intel Cyclone 10 GX and Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGAs to evaluate throughput, and it achieves 25.73-57.1 Mbps.

TI Enhancing Matrix Multiplication With a Monolithic 3-D-Based Scratchpad

DE High performance; matrix multiplication; monolithic 3-D; neural network;
   scratchpad memory (SPM)
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. The convolutional layers, which account for the most execution time of CNNs, are implemented with matrix multiplication because the convolution operation performs dot products between filters and local regions of the input. On the other hand, GPUs with thousands of cores were proven to significantly accelerate matrix multiplication, compared to CPUs with a limited number of cores, especially for large matrices. However, the current memory architecture allows only one row access at a time so that multiple accesses are necessary to read the column data of the second matrix, thus slowing down matrix multiplication. In this study, we adopt the monolithic 3-D integration for the GPU scratchpad memory, called monolithic 3-D integration (M3D) scratchpad memory (SPM), to enhance matrix multiplication. The M3D SPM allows one access to read the column data of the second matrix, similar to the case of the first matrix. The simulation results show that our M3D SPM improves the system performance by 46.3% for the 32x32 matrix multiplication, over the conventional 2-D SPM where the column data of the second matrix are read sequentially.

TI Self-Adaptive Memory Approximation: A Formal Control Theory Approach

DE Approximate computing; control theory; memory hierarchy; system

AB Memory approximation enables trading off quality/accuracy for performance or energy gains. Traditionally, application programmers are burdened with the difficult task of setting memory approximation knobs to achieve the desired quality of service (QoS). Our self-adaptive approach for memory approximation eases the programmer's burden: simply specify the desired quality as a goal, with the system deploying a formal control-theoretic approach to tune the memory approximation knobs and deliver a guaranteed QoS. We model quality configuration tracking as a formal quality control problem, and outline a system identification technique that captures memory approximation effects with variations in application input and system architecture. Preliminary results show that we can alleviate the programmer's burden of manual knob tuning for on-chip memory approximation. When compared with a manual calibration scheme we achieve 3x improvement in average settling time and up to 5x improvement in best case settling time.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit remarkable performance in various machine learning tasks. As sensor-equipped Internet of Things devices permeate into every aspect of modern life, the ability to execute CNN inference, a computationally intensive application, on resource constrained devices has become increasingly important. In this context, we present Cappuccino, a framework for synthesis of efficient inference software targeting mobile system-on-chips (SoCs). We propose techniques for efficient parallelization of CNN inference targeting mobile SoCs, and explore the underlying tradeoffs. Experiments with different CNNs on three mobile devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Executing computing tasks with replications is an essential choice to achieve fault-tolerance in designing real-time, embedded systems. A problem of maximizing the number of real-time tasks with replications running on a multiprocessor embedded system is discussed in this letter. The partitioning problem can be modeled as a variant of the bin-packing problem. In the original problem, it is known that the first-fit (FF) method has a good worst-case performance bound of 4/3. Whether or not the same bound is achievable in the variant problem remains an open question. This letter closes the question by proving that the worst-case performance bound of using the FF method approaches to 2 but it never reaches it. Then, a tight bound of asymptotic worst-case performance is shown.

AB hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging machine learning (ML) method. It is based on large vectors of binary or bipolar symbols and a few simple mathematical operations. The promise of HDC is a highly efficient implementation for embedded systems, such as wearables. While fast implementations have been presented, other constraints have not been considered for edge computing. In this work, we aim at answering how thermal-friendly HDC for edge computing is. Devices, such as smartwatches, smart glasses, or even mobile systems have a restrictive cooling budget due to their limited volume. Although HDC operations are simple, the vectors are large, resulting in a high number of CPU operations and, thus, a heavy load on the entire system potentially causing temperature violations. In this work, the impact of HDC on the chip's temperature is investigated for the first time. We measure the temperature and power consumption of a commercial embedded system and compare HDC with the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN). We reveal that HDC causes up to 6.8 C-? higher temperatures and leads to up to 47 % more CPU throttling. Even when both HDC and CNN aim for the same throughput (i.e., perform a similar number of classifications per second), HDC still causes higher on-chip temperatures due to the larger power consumption.

AB This letter proposes an unsigned approximate multiplier architecture segmented into three portions: the least significant portion that contributes least to the partial product (PP) is replaced with a new constant compensation term to improve hardware savings without sacrificing accuracy. The PPs in the middle portion are simplified using a new 4:2 approximate compressor, and the error due to approximation is compensated using a simple yet efficient error correction module. The most significant portion of the multiplier is implemented using exact logic as approximating it will results in a large error. Experimental results of 8-bit multiplier show that the power and power-delay products are reduced up to 47.7% and 55.2%, respectively, in comparison with the exact design and 36.9% and 39.5%, respectively, in comparison with the existing designs without significant compromise on accuracy.

AB With growing model complexity, mapping spiking neural network (SNN)-based applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz., a crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of presynaptic connections per postsynaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many presynaptic connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in the model quality, e.g., accuracy. In this letter, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes a neuron function with many presynaptic connections into a sequence of homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation node, with two presynaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all presynaptic connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60% lower crossbar requirement, $9\times $ higher synapse utilization, 62% lower wasted energy on the hardware, and between 0.8% and 4.6% increase in the model quality.

AB Fault tolerance is one of the main issues of electronic devices especially for controlling and monitoring of the operations in extreme environments. In this letter, a new memristor-based hybrid approach has been proposed, which combines attractive features of the both static and dynamic methods to introduce a new concurrent reconfigurable structure. The simulation results show that the proposed structure tolerates transient and permanent faults during the run-time with minimum delay, power consumption, and area overhead in comparison to the related works. The proposed work also reaches to minimum silicon protection factor with zero pause time during fault recovery phase.

TI RoadNet: An 80-mW Hardware Accelerator for Road Detection

   vehicle; low power; road detection; very large-scale integration
AB As a fundamental feature of intelligent vehicles, vision-based road detection must be executed on a real-time embedded platform with high accuracy. Road detection is often applied in conjunction with lane detection to determine the drivable regions. Although some existing research based on large deep learning models achieved high accuracy using the road detection dataset, they often did not consider the low power requirement of a typical embedded system. In this letter, an ultralow-power hardware accelerator for road detection is proposed. By adopting a top-down convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, a small CNN, namely RoadNet, is trained that can achieve near state-of-the-art detection accuracy. Furthermore, each CNN layer is trimmed to be computationally identical and every processing element in the architecture is fully utilized. When implemented using 32-nm process technology, the proposed hardware accelerator requires the chip area of 0.45 mm(2) and the power consumption of only 80 mW, which results in an equivalent power efficiency of about 300 GOP/s/W.

AB Illegal memory accesses are a serious security vulnerability that have been exploited on numerous occasions. In this letter, we present Gandalf, a compiler assisted hardware extension for the OpenRISC processor that thwarts all forms of memory-based attacks. We associate lightweight capabilities to all program variables, which are checked at run time by the hardware. Gandalf is transparent to the user and does not require significant OS modifications. Moreover, it achieves locality and incurs minimal overheads in the hardware. We demonstrate these features with a customized Linux kernel executing SPEC2006 benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate a complete solution for hardware-based memory protection schemes for embedded platforms.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art in image classification. Since CNN feed forward propagation involves highly regular parallel computation, it benefits from a significant speed-up when running on fine grain parallel programmable logic devices. As a consequence, several studies have proposed field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators for CNNs. However, because of the large computational power required by CNNs, none of the previous studies has proposed a direct mapping of the CNN onto the physical resources of an FPGA, allocating each processing actor to its own hardware instance. In this letter, we demonstrate the feasibility of the so called direct hardware mapping (DHM) and discuss several tactics we explore to make DHM usable in practice. As a proof of concept, we introduce the HADDOC2 open source tool, that automatically transforms a CNN description into a synthesizable hardware description with platform-independent DHM.

AB Dynamic power management (DPM) techniques on mobile systems are indispensable for deep learning (DL) inference optimization, which is mainly performed on battery-based mobile and/or embedded platforms with constrained resources. To this end, we characterize CNN workloads using object detection applications of YOLOv4/-tiny and YOLOv3/-tiny, and then propose integrated CPU-GPU DVFS governor policies that scale integrated pairs of CPU and GPU frequencies to improve energy-delay product (EDP) with negligible inference execution time degradation. Our results show up to 16.7% EDP improvements with negligible (mostly less than 2%) performance degradation using object detection applications on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

AB Link failure and network congestion have a serious impact on the performance degradation of network on chip (NoC). Adaptive routing algorithms, which have the capability of fault tolerance and congestion awareness, can make NoCs adapt to complex and changeable applications. The proposed algorithm in this letter is an adaptive routing algorithm based on Q -learning. By introducing H - Q table to learn the congestion and fault information of the paths between the source node and the destination node, it can avoid the unnecessary detour of data in the fault area and select the path with less congestion. Aiming at the problem caused by the untimely updating of some values in Q -learning, the Q -value decay and dynamic learning rate mechanism are proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed routing algorithms still can obtain a good performance under a high failure rate (Fault rate > 25%) with modest extra hardware overhead.

AB Layerwise quantized neural networks (QNNs), which adopt different precisions for weights or activations in a layerwise manner, have emerged as a promising approach for embedded systems. The layerwise QNNs deploy only required number of data bits for the computation (e.g., convolution of weights and activations), which in turn reduces computation energy compared to the conventional QNNs. However, the layerwise QNNs still cause a large amount of energy in the conventional memory systems, since memory accesses are not optimized for the required precision of each layer. To address this problem, we propose Quant-PIM, an energy-efficient processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator for layerwise QNNs. Quant-PIM selectively reads only required data bits within a data word depending on the precision, by deploying the modified I/O gating logics in a 3-D stacked memory. Thus, Quant-PIM significantly reduces energy consumption for memory accesses. In addition, Quant-PIM improves the performance of layerwise QNNs. When the required precision is half of the weight (or activation) size or less, Quant-PIM reads two data blocks in a single read operation by exploiting the saved memory bandwidth from the selective memory access, thus providing higher compute-throughput. Our simulation results show that Quant-PIM reduces system energy by 39.1%similar to 50.4% compared to the PIM system with 16-bit quantized precision, without accuracy loss.

DE Network; real-time operating systems (RTOSs); virtio; virtualization
AB Virtualization technology can provide a transparent and efficient software development environment at the development phase of embedded systems. In addition, virtualization can be exploited to provide strong resource isolation between real-time applications. However, since virtualization incurs noticeable overheads, we need to minimize these to utilize virtualization technology for either a software development environment or a runtime environment of real-time embedded systems. In this letter, we particularly focus on virtualization overheads of network I/O and present an implementation of standardized (i.e., virtio) front-end network driver for a real-time operating system (RTOS). Although there have been several studies for virtio on general-purpose OS, our implementation is the first open-source virtio for an RTOS. The measurement results show that our implementation can improve the bandwidth and latency up to 168% and 52%, respectively. In addition, the memory usage can be saved up to 36%.

AB In this letter, we propose VeritAcc, a novel application that enables secure integration of an untrusted third-party matrix multiplication (MM) hardware accelerator in a system-on-chip containing a trusted general purpose processor. Our solution builds upon the theory of interactive proof (IP) protocols to enable run time verification of each computation executed on the untrusted accelerator and formally guarantees that any incorrect results are detected with high probability. Our novel optimizations in hardware implementation reduces area and performance overhead of VeritAcc. We show that an field programmable gate array (FPGA) prototype of VeritAcc introduces less than 6.25% digital signal processing (DSP) area overhead compared to a baseline untrusted MM accelerator while enabling 11x-69x speed-ups compared with software execution.

DE Automated high-level synthesis (HLS); code generation; design space
   exploration (DSE); field-programmable gate array (FPGA);
   hardware/software (HW/SW) partitioning
AB Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are known to increase performance and energy efficiency of parallel applications. Integrated on multiprocessor systems-on-chip, they can be used as accelerators in addition to the multicore processor. However, state-of-the-art high-level synthesis tools require an intensive manual effort to make effective use of all available FPGA resources. This letter proposes an automatic hardware/software partitioning software tool which optimizes for different design goals, such as performance and power. A given source code is analyzed and all necessary decisions and annotations are performed without the need for designer interaction. Further, abstract but accurate power models for FPGA and processor enable power or energy driven optimization. The tool flow is tested against representative benchmarks on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+. On average, an energy reduction of 71% is possible compared to a nonpartitioned, sequential execution.

AB We propose pattern-based execution of control loops as a preferable alternative to traditional fully periodic execution for implementing a set of embedded control systems where the sensors, actuators, and control nodes are connected via a shared wireless network. We use a theoretically sound model for skipping loop executions without compromising stability as the basis for developing an SAT-based approach for synthesizing such schedulable loop execution patterns over multihop (wireless) control networks. We demonstrate superior control performance as compared to controllers designed under the fully periodic solutions.

AB Approximate computing has shown to provide new ways to improve performance and power consumption of error-resilient applications. While many of these applications can be found in image processing, data classification, or machine learning, we demonstrate its suitability to a problem from scientific computing. Utilizing the self-correcting behavior of iterative algorithms, we show that approximate computing can be applied to the calculation of inverse matrix pth roots which are required in many applications in scientific computing. Results show great opportunities to reduce the computational effort and bandwidth required for the execution of the discussed algorithm, especially when targeting special accelerator hardware.

AB Data reduction is an effective technique for energy saving in wireless sensor networks. It consists on reducing sensing and transmitting data while conserving a high quality of collected information. In this letter, we propose an online data reduction model based on Kruskal-Wallis test that allows sensor nodes to adapt their sensing rates based on the data variance. Then, we propose a local aggregation algorithm to reduce further the data set size before sending to the sink. Experimentation on real telosB sensor network testbed shows the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the size of data transmitted over the network and thus saving energy.

AB Reducing job migrations is essential for any global multiprocessor scheduling algorithm. In this letter, we present a global, dynamic-priority, laxity-based algorithm that reduces the number of migrations on multiprocessor embedded systems by leveraging information theory principles. A simplification of the proposed scheduling theory is presented to reduce the overhead caused by using information theory. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce the number of migrations by up to 41.21% when compared with other global, dynamic-priority, laxity-based algorithms. As the utilization per task set and the number of processors increase, simplified information-theoretic scheduling algorithm is able to improve its performance in terms of the number of migrations.

AB Engineers and researchers often require accurate measurements of small execution times or duration of events in a program. Errors in the measurement facility can introduce important challenges, especially when measuring small intervals. Mitigating approaches commonly used exhibit several issues; in particular, they only reduce the effect of the error, and never eliminate it. In this letter, we propose a technique to effectively eliminate measurement errors and obtain a robust statistical estimate of execution time or duration of events in a program. The technique is simple to implement, yet it entirely eliminates the systematic (nonrandom) component of the measurement error, as opposed to simply reduce it. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Three-dimensional technologies offer great promise in providing improvements in the overall circuit performance. This letter introduces a novel netlist partitioning and placement algorithm, named ANT3D, targeting 3-D reconfigurable architectures, based on ant colony optimization (ACO). Experimental results show the effectiveness of ANT3D algorithm as we achieve performance enhancement by 10% on average, compared to state-of-the-art tools, while using significantly fewer through-silicon vias (TSVs). Finally, by taking benefit from the inherent parallelism found in ACO algorithms, it is feasible to notable reduce the execution run-time of our algorithm.

AB Implementing embedded critical system tools using general-purpose programming languages usually challenges conformance to relevant standards. This letter proposes implementing tools that manipulate a system model expressed in extensive markup language using the extensive stylesheet language transformations (XSLT) and related technologies playing specific roles in a particular sequence developed to ease verification, validation, testing, and certification efforts. XSLT is a data-centric, domain-specific language that produces a more straightforward tool implementation, thus reducing human errors. We will introduce the proposal by reviewing, as an example, the reimplementation of a tool initially written in Python that automatically generates the VHDL source code of an embedded critical system. Finally, we will compare both implementations, noting compelling results.

ID VOLUME FRACTION
AB Fiber-reinforced composite parts used in drones, automobiles, and sports equipment are now being manufactured by additive manufacturing (AM), where the material parameters such as fiber direction can be changed within a layer or from one layer to the other. Nondestructive evaluation methods are required to assess the quality of such customized printed parts. In this work, a microcomputed tomography (mu CT) dataset is analyzed to determine the fiber content in a 3-D printed composite material part using a digital binary image processing method. The existing literature on binary image analysis methods to measure the fiber volume fraction is limited to continuous fiber reinforced composites. Discontinuous fiber reinforced 3-D printing filaments are popular in manufacturing parts with increased strength. The methods developed in this work expands the binary image process to scans that show fibers embedded lengthwise in different directions in the 3-D printed layers. An optimized thresholding method is trained on the filament sample and then applied to 3-D printed samples. The results show fiber volume fraction measurements with standard deviations below 0.15%. The results in this work will be useful for product quality validation.

ID SILICON NANOWIRE TRANSISTORS
AB Reconfigurable field effect transistors (RFETs) are an emerging technology platform that offers the possibility to merge n-type and p-type functionalities in a single device. From the circuit perspective, this feature enables layout camouflaged designs by realizing polymorphic logic gates with dynamically reconfigurable functions. In this work, mixed-mode simulations employing a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) model of RFETs with three gates are presented. Three different designs for reconfigurable NAND/NOR logic gates are analyzed in order to optimize the equalization of both operational modes delay traces. Moreover, work function fluctuations arising from process variations are considered to prove that their inevitable presence can be exploited to further increase the level of obfuscation between those modes. Statistical analysis of the results from 100 simulated devices shows effective overlapping of the distribution of the delays extracted at half the value of the drain voltage. Together with a good resilience against supply voltage variations in fault induction attacks schemes, these results suggest how this emerging technology can grow up and evolve to play an interesting role in the field of hardware security.

AB In this pilot study, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of utilizing smartphone-connected electrophysiological biosensors for measuring blood glucose level (BGL) in a type-2 diabetic (T2D) patient using machine learning (ML). Patients' electrophysiological parameters are measured using commercially available, smartphone operated/embedded electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensors; simultaneously, we measure the BGL of the patient using a minimal invasive (MI) biosensor mounted on the patient's arm. Statistical correlation analysis confirms that a modest correlation exists between the extracted ECG and PPG features and the measured BGL. The efficacy of ML models trained using the regression tree algorithm utilizing ECG and PPG extracted features for predicting the BGL is investigated. Experimental results show that ECG and PPG feature trained ML models can successfully predict BGL upto +/- (8-33 mg/dL) during fasting, pre-prandial, and post-prandial intervals.

AB Measurement-based probabilistic timing analysis, a probabilistic real-time computing method, is based on the extreme value theory (EVT), a statistical theory applied to worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis on real-time embedded systems. The output of the EVT theory is a statistical distribution, in the form of generalized extreme value distribution or generalized Pareto distribution. Their cumulative distribution function can asymptotically assume one of the three possible forms: 1) light; 2) exponential; or 3) heavy tail. Recently, several works proposed to upper-bound the light-tail distributions with their exponential version. In this letter, we show that this assumption is valid only under certain conditions and that it is often misinterpreted. This leads to unsafe estimations of the WCET, which cannot be accepted in applications targeting safety critical embedded systems.

AB An alternative computing paradigm is explored in this letter with application to wirelessly powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Contrary to existing methods that rely on DC computing, the wirelessly harvested AC power is directly used for computation by leveraging charge-recycling theory. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly reduce the energy cost, one of the primary barriers that slows down the global scalability of IoT devices. This opportunity and related challenges are investigated in this letter to provide guidelines for future research in the field.

AB Monitoring sheep activity can be crucial for improving productivity and animal welfare. This work presents the design, manufacture, and test of a collar-type device to monitor sheep behavior. The device consists of an MSP-EXP432P401R microcontroller from Texas Instruments, a Bosch Sensortec's BMI160 3-axis accelerometer, and a narrowband-IoT BG96 modem from Quectel that includes a global positioning system. The device has two operating modes: 1) validation mode (VM) to test and validate algorithms for characterizing sheep activity and 2) research mode (RM) to support multiday animal experiments to study their behavior. In VM, it sends accelerometer data, the animal's state (run, walk, stand, or head down), and the location to the Central System every 20 s. VM has an autonomy of 51 h. In RM, the device transmits the animal's state and the location every 2 or more minutes to extend the autonomy to more than ten days. The microcontroller identifies the sheep's states (every 5 s) using real-time accelerometer data processed with an algorithm based on the linear discriminant analysis method. We trained a classifier on a PC using a public dataset, and then we ported it to the microcontroller. Preliminary tests show that the sheep's state identification has a prediction success rate of 88%, opening exciting possibilities for developing an applicable device.

AB This letter proposes a multigateway designation framework to design real-time wireless sensor networks (WSNs) improving traffic schedulability, i.e., meeting the traffic time constraints. To this end, we resort to spectral clustering-unsupervised learning that allows defining arbitrary $k$ disjoint clusters without the knowledge of the node's physical position. In each cluster, we use a centrality metric from social sciences to designate one gateway. This novel combination is applied to a time-synchronized channel-hopping (TSCH) WSN under earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling and shortest path routing. Simulation results under varying configurations show that our framework is able to produce WSN designs that greatly reduce the worst case network demand. In a situation with five gateways, 99% schedulability can be achieved with 3.5 times more real-time flows than in a random benchmark.

AB This document describes the design and implementation sequence of hardware and firmware components of two microcontroller boards of 8-bit and 32-bit architectures, which use similar form factors and share common input/output devices and recently developed Web-based user interfaces. These developments are the result of over two decades of experimentation in educational and research measurement systems in renewable energy projects. The boards are intended to fill a gap between low-cost hobby systems and high-end research loggers, especially where international standards require control of uncertainties, as is the case with small wind turbine power curve assessments. The focus was to increase reliability in the hardware aspects and make software development easier by including user-friendly firmware and a set of in-house C language coding rules for new developments and refactoring of legacy code. Testing of the low-level driver sections and the use of automated tools such as Ceedling for higher-level module testing are also described.

TI Supporting Safe Priority Adjustment for Software-Defined Real-Time

   software-defined networking (SDN)
AB It is essential to support real-time communication in networked control systems, such as automotive systems or smart factories. Several studies have been conducted to schedule real-time flows by adjusting their priorities using software-defined networking (SDN). However, because its architecture was not initially designed for real-time communication, unexpected challenges may occur if it is not utilized carefully. In particular, because SDN does not provide an atomic method for priority adjustment, some flows may violate their timing constraints by receiving additional interference during priority adjustment. In this letter, we propose novel schemes to update the flow priorities safely in SDN-based real-time systems. To this end, we first analyze such problems through two types of cases. Then, we develop schemes that determine a safe procedure for priority adjustment and synchronize the priority settings of all switches. By network emulations, we demonstrate that the above problem occurs in 149 out of 300 flow sets, but our schemes can effectively prevent all of them.

AB Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) used in commercial many-core processors typically incorporate priority arbitration. Moreover, they experience bursty traffic due to application workloads. However, most state-of-the-art NoC analytical performance analysis techniques assume fair arbitration and simple traffic models. To address these limitations, we propose an analytical modeling technique for priority-aware NoCs under bursty traffic. Experimental evaluations with synthetic and bursty traffic show that the proposed approach has less than 10% modeling error with respect to cycle-accurate NoC simulator.

AB With an ever-increasing complexity of hardware/software architectures, system-level simulation is intensively used to address the need for early performance evaluation. In this letter, we introduce a generic executable model that provides fast system simulation with preserved accuracy about shared resource usage. The proposed executable model involves a limited number of simulation events by using instantaneous computation and retroactive correction methods of synchronization instants among applications' processes. We evaluated our approach on applications with various numbers of tasks and different levels of contention at shared resources. Our observations show that we can achieve the same accuracy with an average speedup of 2.53 compared to the traditional simulation approach.

AB We present an error-correcting architecture for cryptographic circuits that are exposed to maliciously injected faults. The architecture is based on a new class of error-detecting and correcting codes, which combine high rate, large distance, and robustness; that is, they can detect all error patterns injected by a skillful and strategic attacker and automatically correct simpler errors. Correction of errors is superior to detection since it avoids service disruptions and system-level recovery actions. We investigate the architectures using both mathematical analysis and physical fault injection on an field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform, and point out critical divergences between these methods and the need to employ both of them.

DE Fault injection attack; JTAG; system on chip (SoC)
AB Fault injection attacks are wide spread in the domain of smart cards and microcontrollers but have not been yet democratized on complex embedded microprocessors, such as system on chip that can be found in smart phones, tablets, and automotive systems. The main explanation is the difficulty involved in injecting a fault at the right place and at the right time to make these attacks effective on such devices. However, for development and debugging, these devices provide new tools that could be considered as possibly enabling attacks. One of them, the JTAG debug tool is present on most electronic devices today. In this letter, we present the first fault injection attack based on JTAG. Using the example of a privilege escalation attack, we detail how this tool can be used either to check the feasibility of this attack by fault injection or to perform an actual attack.

AB Customized instructions have typically been used for enhancing the performance of embedded systems. However, the use of finding dedicated instructions for security has been rather limited. On the contrary, modern processors are crippled by the threats of memory integrity attacks, which typically target the control flow of a program and are mitigated at the software level. In this letter, we analyze the memory exploitation codes being developed as a part of the Cyber Security Awareness Week-2016 competition, which are based on unsecured memcpy and return address modification by buffer overflow on OpenRISC and RISC-V architectures, and implement protections at the hardware level. We added eight new instructions to handle the four exploits by designing dedicated hardware stack and a module for checking against buffer overflow. We have also performed a validation on RISC-V platform and introduced two new custom instructions to ensure security from unbounded memcpy. The proposed countermeasures and the new instructions are validated on field programmable gate array platform.

AB An Android-based application has been developed which can convert any mobile phone with inbuilt accelerometer into a squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) fault diagnosis tool. To detect the faults, the mobile phone needs to be attached to the motor, and the application will record the motor vibration signal using the inbuilt accelerometer. After the recording, the faults are detected by locating the fault frequencies in the motor vibration spectrum. The developed application can also detect the motor faults from any previously recorded files of vibration data. The application has been tested on a 22 kW SCIM using Moto G4 Plus and Moto G5 Plus Android phones. Unlike the other SCIM fault diagnosis systems, the proposed method does not require any dedicated sensors, processing platforms, and power supply arrangements.

AB This letter describes our source-level debugger for Arduino which can be used to debug the code in Arduino using GNU debugger. The presented solution uses Eclipse as the visual front-end. It does not require any modification of the Arduino board or additional hardware; debug functionality is achieved by adding a program library to the user application. Standard functionality expected from a debugger is available, such as setting breakpoints while debugging, stepping through the code and viewing variables. This allows developing projects with Arduino more efficiently and also using the Arduino for teaching embedded programming at a more advanced level, including debugging the program.

DE Biased fault; differential attack; fault intensity
AB In this letter, we analyze a class of recently proposed fault analysis techniques, which adopt a biased fault model. The purpose of our analysis is to evaluate the relative efficiency of several recently proposed biased-fault attacks. We compare the relative performance of each technique in a common framework, using a common circuit and a common fault injection method. We show that, for an identical circuit and fault injection method (setup time violation through clock glitching), the number of faults per attack greatly varies according to the analysis technique. In particular, DFIA is more efficient than FSA, and FSA is more efficient than both NUEVA and NUFVA. In terms of number of fault injections until full key disclosure, for a typical case, FSA uses 8x more faults than DFIA, and NUEVA uses 33x more faults than DFIA. Hence, the postprocessing technique selected in a biased-fault attack has a significant impact on the success of the attack.

ID POWER ANALYSIS
AB Because of its strong leakage characterization ability and high-key-recovery efficiency, template attack (TA) is the strongest side-channel attack from the information-theoretic point-of-view. In light of this, TA can be used as a powerful tool to evaluate the security of a crypto device in real scenarios. In fact, by evaluating the key-recovery efficiency of TA, the security of a crypto device can be quantified. Therefore, it is very meaningful to optimize the key-recovery efficiency of TA in real scenarios. In this work, we show that the leakage exploitation style can significantly influence the key-recovery efficiency of TA. In detail, rather than exploiting the leakage of the noise part, the leakage of the squared noise part can be used in TA. Theoretically, by exploiting the leakage of the squared noise part, the key-recovery efficiency of TA can be optimized under the normalized difference metric. Empirically, with the evaluation data provided by DPA Contest and ASCAD, the key-recovery efficiency of TA can be optimized under the success rate metric. Overall, this contribution may help one to accurately evaluate the security of a crypto device in real scenarios.

SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Concolic testing; concretization; line coverage
AB Concolic testing is a software testing technique, which improves the scalability of symbolic execution by allowing efficient concretization of symbolic expressions. Concretization converts a symbolic expression to a concrete value, e.g., when the constraints of a symbolic expression become too complex for the utilized solver to handle. Unfortunately, concretization negatively impacts completeness of the performed analysis. For example, if a branch in the tested program depends on a previously symbolic value, which is now concrete, this branch will not be tracked by the symbolic execution engine. As such, the tested code is not explored in its entirety and errors may remain undetected. In order to allow a verification engineer to identify code parts which have not been tested sufficiently, due to concretization, we propose a novel metric, which quantifies performed concretizations. Furthermore, we contribute a visualization of this metric, which eases identifying code parts, which depend, directly or indirectly, on symbolic values affected by concretization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing a concretization metric for concolic testing, to stimulate further research on this topic we have released our implementation as open-source software.

TI HASTE: Software Security Analysis for Timing Attacks on Clear Hardware

AB Information leakage via timing side-channel analysis can compromise embedded systems used in diverse applications that are otherwise secure. Most state-of-the-art timing sidechannel detection techniques focus on analyzing the software code while paying little to no attention to the underlying hardware. This limits the ability of such techniques in terms of detection and repair. In this letter, we propose a timing side-channel analysis framework that takes into consideration both the software and the underlying hardware microarchitecture to detect vulnerabilities with high precision. We also propose a set of metrics to quantify the severity of the vulnerabilities. We verify our proposed framework on two different computation subroutines which are widely used in crypto and secure systems.

AB Domain-specific systems-on-chip (DSSoCs) aim at bridging the gap between application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and general-purpose processors. Traditional operating system (OS) schedulers can undermine the potential of DSSoCs since their execution times can be orders of magnitude larger than the execution time of the task itself. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic adaptive scheduling (DAS) framework that combines the benefits of a fast (low-overhead) scheduler and a slow (sophisticated, high-performance but high-overhead) scheduler. Experiments with five real-world streaming applications show that DAS consistently outperforms both the fast and slow schedulers. For 40 different workloads, DAS achieves 1.29x speedup and 45% lower EDP than the sophisticated scheduler at low data rates and 1.28x speedup and 37% lower EDP than the fast scheduler when the workload intensifies.

AB Reconfiguration is a crucial method to improve the fault-tolerant capability of the integrated modular avionics (IMA) system. The quality of the blueprints has a substantial influence on operational performance after the system reconfiguration. Hence, this letter proposes an intelligent reconfiguration algorithm, which applies reinforcement learning (RL) to the IMA system. The proposed algorithm combines the critical elements of the RL model with the established IMA reconfiguration model to generate low-cost and high-quality blueprints. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only generate feasible blueprints rapidly but also enhance system performance by optimizing load balance and reconfiguration costs.

AB Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of accidents and fatal road crashes, causing a high human and economic cost. Recently, automatic drowsiness detection has begun to be recognized as a promising solution, receiving growing attention from industry and academics. In this letter, we propose to embed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based solution in smart connected glasses to detect eye blinks and use them to estimate the driver's drowsiness level. This innovative solution is compared with a more traditional method, based on a detection threshold mechanism. The performance, battery lifetime, and memory footprint of both solutions are assessed for embedded implementation in the connected glasses. The results demonstrate that CNN outperforms the accuracy obtained by the threshold-based algorithm by more than 7%. Moreover, increased overheads in terms of memory and battery lifetime are acceptable, thus making CNN a viable solution for drowsiness detection in wearable devices.

ID DYNAMIC POWER MANAGEMENT
AB Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is one of the most popular and exploited techniques to reduce power consumption in multicore embedded systems. However, this technique might lead to a task-reliability degradation because scaling the voltage and frequency increases the fault rate and the worst-case execution time of the tasks. In order to preserve task-reliability at an acceptable level as well as achieving power saving, in this letter, we have proposed an enhanced DVFS method based on reinforcement learning to reduce the power consumption of sporadic tasks at runtime in multicore embedded systems without task-reliability degradation. The reinforcement learner takes decisions based on the power savings and task-reliability variations due to DVFS and considers the suitable voltage-frequency level for all tasks such that the timing constraints are met. Experimental evaluation was done on different configurations and with different numbers of tasks to investigate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our experiments show that our proposed method works efficiently than other existing works for reducing power consumption without reliability degradation and deadline misses.

AB While many approximate computing methods are quite application-dependent, reducing the size of the data representation used in the computation has a more general applicability. We present a tuning assistant for floating to fixed point optimization (TAFFO), an LLVM-based framework designed to assist programmers in the precision tuning of software. We discuss the framework architecture and we provide guidelines to effectively tradeoff precision to improve the time-to-solution. We evaluate our framework on a well-known approximate computing benchmark suite, AxBench, achieving a speedup on 5 out of 6 benchmarks (up to 366%) with only a limited loss in precision (<3% for all benchmarks). Contrary to most related tools, TAFFO supports both C and C++ programs. It is provided as a plugin for LLVM, a design solution that improves significantly the maintainability of the tool and its ease of use.

TI Uniform Minimal First: Latency Reduction in Throughput-Optimal Oblivious
   Routing for Mesh-Based Networks-on-Chip
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Networks-on-chip; oblivious routing
AB Mesh-based networks-on-chips (NoCs) are increasingly used for on-chip communications in embedded multicore processors. O1TURN is a well-known oblivious routing algorithm for mesh-based NoCs that has been shown to be worst-case throughput optimal for even network radices, but not for odd radices. More recently, another oblivious routing algorithm called U2TURN has been shown to be worst-case throughput optimal for both odd and even radices. This is accomplished by load-balancing among 2-turn paths in XYX or YXY routing, including nonminimal paths. Besides being worst-case throughput optimal, U2TURN achieves higher throughput than O1TURN under adversarial traffic. However, for random traffic, where the traffic is inherently load-balanced, O1TURN achieves lower network latency since it only considers minimal paths. In this letter, we propose a hybrid oblivious routing algorithm called uniform-minimal-first (UMF) routing. UMF works by exploiting any inherent load-balancing characteristics of the traffic pattern to reduce packet latency, but it retains the throughput optimality of U2TURN for both odd and even radices, and it achieves the performance of U2TURN under adversarial traffic. UMF is very inexpensive to implement as it just requires incrementing two small counters, but only for the head flit when a node injects a new packet (not for any pass-through traffic). These simple updates can be performed one cycle ahead of packet injection to avoid slowing down any router pipeline stage. Despite its simplicity, UMF outperforms U2TURN by 23.7% under random traffic and O1TURN by 12.6% under adversarial traffic.

TI i-DPs CGRA: An Interleaved-Datapaths Reconfigurable Accelerator for
   Embedded Bio-Signal Processing
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Bio-signal processing; coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs);
   single instruction-multiple data (SIMD); ultralow power
AB Smart edge sensors for bio-signal monitoring must support complex signal processing routines within an extremely small energy envelope. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) are good candidates for tackling these conflicting objectives, because thanks to their flexibility and high computational density they can efficiently support the computational hot-spots characterizing bio-digital signal processing applications. The interleaved-datapaths (i-DPs) CGRA presented in this letter further leverages the benefits of this architectural paradigm, focusing on ultralow energy operation. Its defining feature is the complex design of its computing cells, which, by embedding multiple i-DPs, allow a high ratio between computing and control logic, effectively speeding up computations and resulting in a marginal impact on the required integrated circuit area. i-DPs increase the energy efficiency of up to 33%, with respect to a single-DP alternative, when executing common kernels in the multilead electrocardiogram signal processing field.

AB Subgraph enumeration is one of the most crucial steps involved in the custom instruction identification for application-specific instruction set processors. Generating all connected convex subgraphs from an acyclic digraph is a computationally difficult problem. In this letter, we propose a simple and fast algorithm for enumerating all connected convex subgraphs in acyclic digraphs. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the latest algorithm in the literature. We also present a parallel approach for enumerating all connected convex subgraphs using MapReduce. Results for real world benchmarks covering different application domains reveal that the parallel approach can achieve near linear speedup over the sequential approach.

AB A monitoring and locating system for sailboats is developed using the general packet radio service/global system for mobile communications (GPRS/GSM) and global positioning system (GPS) technology. The implemented prototype can track the location of sailboats that do not go out more than 10 km into the sea. The system uses a GPS module to obtain the boat's coordinates; it has a sensing station: environmental temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and the angular movement of the ship. A structured query language (SQL) database has been implemented to store data received via AVR-GPRS. System monitoring tests were carried out over a 24-km route onboard a sailboat, obtaining its location during the entire course along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico.

TI Robust and Accurate Fine-Grain Power Models for Embedded Systems With No

AB This letter presents a novel approach to event-based power modeling for embedded platforms that do not have a performance monitoring unit (PMU). The method involves complementing the target hardware platform, where the physical power data is measured, with another platform on which the CPU performance data, that is needed for model generation, can be collected. The methodology is used to generate accurate fine-grain power models for the Gaisler GR712RC dual-core LEON3 fault-tolerant SPARC processor with onboard power sensors and no PMU. A Kintex Ultra-Scale field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is used as the support platform to obtain the required CPU performance data, by running a soft-core representation of the dual-core LEON3 as on the GR712RC but with a PMU implementation. Both platforms execute the same benchmark set and data collection is synchronized using per-sample timestamps so that the power sensor data from the GR712RC board can be matched to the PMU data from the FPGA. The synchronized samples are then processed by the Robust Energy and Power Predictor Selection (REPPS) software in order to generate power models. The models achieve less than 2% power estimation error when validated on an industrial use case and can follow program phases, which makes them suitable for runtime power profiling during development.

DT Article
DE Approximate computing; approximate multiplier; image compression; image
   sharpening; low-power
AB Approximate computing is a promising method for designing power-efficient computing systems. Many image and compression algorithms are inherently error-tolerant and can allow errors up to a specific limit. In such algorithms, savings in power can be achieved by approximating the data path units, such as a multiplier. This letter presents a novel decoder logic-based multiplier design with the intent to reduce the partial products generated. Thus, leading to a reduction in the hardware complexity and power consumption while maintaining a low error rate. Our proposed design in an 8-bit format which achieves 40.96% and 22.30% power reduction compared to the accurate and approximate multipliers. Comprehensive simulations are carried out on image sharpening and compression algorithms to prove that the proposed design obtains a better quality-effort tradeoff than the existing multipliers.

TI Switch-Based High Cardinality Node Detection
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Anomaly detection; cardinality estimation; network monitoring;
   supernodes
AB The detection of supernodes with high cardinality is of interest for network monitoring and security. Existing schemes for supernode detection rely on data structures that are independent of the switching functions. This means that for each packet that traverses the switch, both the switching table and the supernode detection structure have to be checked which requires significant memory bandwidth. This can create a bottleneck and reduce the speed of the switch, especially for software implementations. In this letter, a scheme that performs supernode detection as part of Ethernet switching and does not require additional memory accesses nor separated data structures is presented. The scheme has been implemented and compared with the existing methods. The results show that the proposed scheme can reliably identify supernodes while providing a speed up of more than 15% when compared with the existing solutions.

TI Data-Driven Identification of Consumers With Deferrable Loads for Demand
   Response Programs
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Deferrable loads; demand response (DR); flexibility; time-series
   analysis
AB Power utilities leverage demand response (DR) events to effectively reduce the peak load at critical times with excessive power demand. DR programs are generally categorized as manual or automated from the automation perspective. The opportunities for automated DR in the residential sector have emerged with the integration of smart and connected loads. For example, smart appliances with deferrable loads can be scheduled to shift their load without consumers' direct involvement, given that many consumers might not engage sufficiently to participate in the manual DR. However, it has been shown that unjustified load shifting from many consumers in peak times could result in high off-peak demand. Therefore, it is essential for utilities to identify and target consumers for participation according to efficacy criteria. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose a data-driven method for the selection of consumers according to their potential for demand reduction in a DR program. The proposed method characterizes the frequency, consistency, and the peak time usage of deferrable loads across several subsequent days. By measuring the impact on peak-load shaving, we evaluated our approach on a subset of electricity dataset from the Pecan Street Dataport. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in selecting consumers with deferrable loads based on their potential for demand reduction in the future events.

   pooling; overhead; spiking neural network (SNN)
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been shown to be accurate, fast, and efficient in classical machine vision tasks, such as object recognition or detection. It is typical to convert a pretrained deep neural network into an SNN since training SNN is not easy. The max-pooling (MP) function is widely adopted in most state-of-the-art deep neural networks. To maintain the accuracy of the SNN obtained through conversion, this function is an important element to be implemented. However, it is difficult due to the dynamic characteristics of spikes. As far as we know, existing solutions adopt additional technologies except the spiking neuron model to implement MP or approximate MP, which introduce overhead of memory storage and computation. In this letter, we propose a novel method that utilizes only the spiking neuron model to approximate MP. Our method does not incur any overhead. We validate our method with three datasets and six networks including three oxford visual geometry group-like networks. And the experimental results show that the performance (accuracy and convergence rate) of our method is as good as or even better than that of the existing method.

TI Combining Automated Measurement-Based Cost Modeling With Static
   Worst-Case Execution-Time and Energy-Consumption Analyses

AB Predicting the temporal behavior of embedded real-time systems is a crucial but challenging task, as it is with the energetic behavior of energy-constrained systems, such as IoT devices. To carry out static analyses in order to determine the worst-case execution time or the worst-case energy consumption of tasks, cost models are inevitable. However, these models are rarely available on a fine-grained level for commercial-off-the-shelf hardware platforms. In this letter, we present NEO, an end-to-end toolchain that automatically generates cost models, which are then integrated into an existing static-analysis tool. NEO exploits automatically generated benchmark programs, which are measured on the target platform and investigated in a virtual machine. Based on the gathered data, we formulate mathematical optimization problems that eventually yield both worst-case execution-time and energy-consumption cost models. In our evaluations with an embedded hardware platform (e.g., ARM Cortex-M0+), we show that the open-source toolchain is able to precisely bound programs' resources while achieving acceptable accuracy.

TI Condition Codes Evaluation on Dynamic Binary Translation for Embedded

DE Condition codes (CCs); debug monitor; dynamic binary translation (DBT);
   embedded systems; lazy evaluation (LE)
AB A widely recognized issue when implementing dynamic binary translation is the condition codes (CCs) or flag bits emulation. The authors in the literature have approached this problem with software optimization techniques based on dataflow analysis, instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions and additional dedicated hardware, i.e., field-programmable gate array. We introduce a novel technique to handle CCs using commercial off-the-shelf architectural debug hardware as a triggering mechanism while assessing and comparing it with two existent CCs evaluation methods on the resource-constrained embedded systems arena. Our method is functionality-wise comparable with reconfigurable hardware modules or ISA extensions in open architectures and is source architecture independent, with possible applications in other use scenarios, such as application debugging and instrumentation.

DE Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); min-entropy estimation; true
   random number generators (TRNGs)
AB Health tests (on-the-fly tests) play an important role in true random number generators because they are used to assess the quality of the bits produced by entropy source and to raise an alert when failures or attacks are detected. Most of classical tests are implemented as statistical tests. A set of new health tests based on predictors was presented by National Institute of Standards and Technology in CHES 2015. These off-line tests attempt to predict the next output of the entropy source by trying to learn the patterns that the previously produced sequence of bits may possess. We provide the first integrated lightweight implementation of prediction-based tests for min-entropy estimation and verify their validity.

AB This letter presents a novel leading zero counter (LZC) able to efficiently exploits the hardware resources available within state-of-the-art FPGA devices to achieve high-speed performances with limited energy consumption. Post-implementation results, obtained for operands bit-widths varying between 4- and 64-bit, demonstrate that the new design improves its direct competitors in terms of occupied lookup tables (LUTs), power consumption, and computational speed. As an example, when implemented using the Xilinx Artix-7 xc7a100tcsg324 device, the new 64-bit LZC utilizes up to 36% less LUTs, dissipates up to 2.8 times lower power and is up to 20% faster than state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB Recently, drones are increasingly being used as innovative IoT sensors. The application contexts of UAV systems where there is often a need to transmit time-critical data between the drone and the Internet are increasingly numerous and varied. Keeping this in mind and assuming that most professional UAVs are equipped with multiinterface routers and use virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure reliable, robust, and secure transmission to the operation room, this letter presents a technique to enhance real-time and time-critical communications such as real-time video streaming. An embedded system, Raspberry-based gateway prototype, was used to create a testbed using a professional drone that captured and transmitted real-time video during a 30-min flight over a rural area characterized by poor mobile radio coverage. A perceptual video quality assessment tool, video multimethod assessment fusion (VMAF), has been employed to evaluate the improvement in terms of video quality perceived by the operator.

TI Efficient HLS Implementation of Fast Linear Discriminant Analysis

AB Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification is widely used in the current field of machine learning and data mining. However, its computational complexity tends to cause high processing latency when implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), especially for high-dimensional data. This letter proposes a method to reduce computational complexity, which uses principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain the most representative characteristics of the original data for projection. Instead of the original data, the dimension-reduced data obtained by the projection will be used for classification. Moreover, when there is only one main characteristic value, not only the matrix inversion operation is avoided but also a large number of matrix multiplication operations are simplified. The implementation of the classifier on FPGA is realized using high-level synthesis (HLS), which can effectively save hardware development time. The results show that the method has an encouraging performance in reducing the execution time of the algorithm on FPGA, while the accuracy of the classifier can also be guaranteed.

DE Field programmable gate array (FPGA); hardware design; high-level
   synthesis (HLS); lattice-based cryptography; post-quantum cryptography
AB Compared to traditional hardware development methodologies, high-level synthesis (HLS) offers a faster time-to-market and lower design-cost at the expense of implementation efficiency. Although HLS tools are becoming popular in some applications, such as digital signal processing and neural network classification, their usability on cryptographic applications is largely unexplored. This feasibility is critical especially for cryptosystems that are under development, such as the next-generation public-key cryptosystems needed for quantum-resistance. This letter provides a thorough investigation of HLS on number theoretic transform (NTT)-the core arithmetic function of lattice-based quantum-resistant cryptosystems. We demonstrate a fast yet extensive design space exploration of NTT through the Vivado HLS tool, analyze the shortcomings/challenges of optimized configurations, and quantitatively compare the results to software-based and hand-coded hardware designs.

   (PLC); supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
AB During its nascent stages, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) were made robust to sustain tough industrial environments, but little care was taken to raise defenses against potential cyberthreats. The recent interconnectivity of legacy PLCs and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems with corporate networks and the Internet has significantly increased the threats to critical infrastructure. To counter these threats, researchers have put their efforts in finding defense mechanisms that can protect the SCADA network and the PLCs. Encryption and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) have been used by many organizations to protect data and the network against cyber-attacks. However, since PLC vendors do not make available information about their hardware or software, it becomes challenging for researchers to embed security mechanisms into their devices. This letter describes an alternative design using an open source PLC that was modified to encrypt all data it sends over the network, independently of the protocol used. Additionally, a machine learning-based IPS was added to the PLC network stack providing a secure mechanism against network flood attacks like denial of service (DoS). Experimental results indicated that the encryption layer and the IPS increased the security of the link between the PLC and the supervisory software, preventing interception, injection, and DoS attacks.

AB Recent research has emphasized the benefits of adaptively regulating the sampling rate of a plant as a function of its state of operation. In this letter, we study the problem in the context of the wide variety of low power embedded systems, where sampling rate has a direct relationship with power consumption. We propose a methodology for designing multirate controllers that switch between sampling rates depending on the disturbance levels while operating under a given energy budget. Our empirical studies indicate that better control performance can be achieved within the energy budget by adaptive regulation of the sampling rate, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of our proposal.

AB The emergence of hardware multithread (HW-MT) architectures increased the performance of MT applications. However, traditional HW-MT architectures are not suitable to real-time operating systems as their performance-oriented scheduling algorithm may conflict with RTOS software scheduling. This letter presents RT-SHADOWS, a portable architecture which provides a unified hardware-software scheduling, bringing the benefits of HW-MT to the RTOS domain. We show that tightly-coupled real-time compliant hardware integration achieves throughput benefits, maintaining the RTOS scheduling policy intact while increasing the predictability of RTOSes. Our solution shows on average, speed-ups between 3 and 4 times over the native versions with very low area usage/performance overhead ratio, due to its minimal cost (2% of extra slices per hardware-supported thread). This work surpasses related work by providing a complete and agnostic hardware solution which is independent of any specific RTOS.

AB Hyperdimensional vector processing is a nascent computing approach that mimics the brain structure and offers lightweight, robust, and efficient hardware solutions for different learning and cognitive tasks. For image recognition and classification, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) utilizes the intensity values of captured images and the positions of image pixels. Traditional HDC systems represent the intensity and positions with binary hypervectors of 1K-10K dimensions. The intensity hypervectors are cross-correlated for closer values and uncorrelated for distant values in the intensity range. The position hypervectors are pseudo-random binary vectors generated iteratively for the best classification performance. In this study, we propose a radically new approach for encoding image data in HDC systems. Position hypervectors are no longer needed by encoding pixel intensities using a deterministic approach based on quasi-random sequences. The proposed approach significantly reduces the number of operations by eliminating the position hypervectors and the multiplication operations in the HDC system. Additionally, we suggest a hybrid technique for generating hypervectors by combining two deterministic sequences, achieving higher classification accuracy. Our experimental results show up to 102x reduction in runtime and significant memory usage savings with improved accuracy compared to a baseline HDC system with conventional hypervector encoding.

AB Autonomous vehicles are latency-sensitive systems. The planning phase is a critical component of such systems, during which the in-vehicle compute platform is responsible for determining the future maneuvers that the vehicle will follow. In this letter, we present a GPU-accelerated optimized implementation of the Frenet Path Planner, a widely known path planning algorithm. Unlike the current state of the art, our implementation accelerates the entire algorithm, including the path generation and collision avoidance phases. We measure the execution time of our implementation and demonstrate dramatic speedups compared to the CPU baseline implementation. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different precision types (double, float, and half) on trajectory errors to investigate the tradeoff between completion latencies and computation precision.

AB In real-time systems, it is essential to verify the end-to-end constraints that regulate the external input/output (I/O) semantics of the head and tail tasks in each effect chain during the design phase and preserve them during implementation. The logical execution time (LET) model has been adopted by the industry due to the predictability and composability of its timed behavior. However, during the execution of LET-based effect chains, there are ineffective jobs whose outputs are redundant or unused and do not contribute to the external I/O behavior. This letter proposes an offline optimization method for deriving multiframe tasks that achieve the external timed I/O semantics of the LET-based effect chains with reduced utilization. The method first removes ineffective jobs from each effect chain and further explores the benefits of removing jobs for single and crossing effect chains by loosening the LET interval. The method is evaluated using synthetic benchmarks that mimic real-world automotive applications.

AB Binary logic is applied internally to almost all digital signal processing and computer systems, because binary logic is direct implemented in CMOS circuits. Stochastic logic is achieved through its particular representation of data, which uses the probability of the logic level being ON to represent data. Stochastic logic computing is a type of logic computation based on stochastic bit stream instead of the binary numbers. This letter proposes a hybrid computing system of binary logic and stochastic logic, called hybrid logic. The study discusses how to generate hybrid logic circuits, and demonstrates the properties of hybrid logic circuits.

AB Many embedded systems operate under real-time conditions. For them, the worst case execution time (WCET) is a crucial information to check whether the software implementation meets the requirements. In modern microcontrollers, this WCET can often no longer be evaluated statically since these processors include too many unpredictable components (cache, bus arbitration,...,). Here, hybrid WCET estimation comes into play, where measured traces are used to empirically compute bounds for the WCET. For meaningful estimations, it is required to put each measured segment into a corresponding execution context. In this contribution, we present a method that allows to gather such context-sensitive statistics online in hardware. This enables arbitrary long measurement intervals with a precision that compares to state-of-the-art offline tools.

This brought about another problem: a gap between the quantity of new mechanical ventilators and the number of skilled physicians to operate them. New physicians could not complete training at the pace of ventilator production, which threatened to leave patients sitting untreated, next to unusable ventilators. To address this challenge, we developed a universal remote control system for makeshift ventilators that uses low-cost hardware add-on modules to connect to different ventilators, and a three-tier control architecture to interface the ventilators with telemedicine software. We demonstrate system integration with two representative ventilator designs, adding a remote control option that allows caregivers to quickly and easily monitor and control these ventilators remotely.

   acoustic communication (UAC)
AB Underwater acoustic communication (UAC) modem is an important infrastructure of underwater network construction. In recent years, with the performance improvement of the STM32 processor, the realization of reliable UAC through high-performance STM32 processor is conducive to reduce the system power consumption, cheapen the hardware cost, and ease the development difficulty. In this letter, we propose an embedded UAC system with the STM32H743 processor as the core and the peripheral sending/receiving circuit as the signal conditioning circuit module. The system can support a variety of modulation and demodulation methods, including single/multi-carrier frequency-shift keying and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. Furthermore, in order to reduce the computational cost of the system, a fast and robust frame synchronization algorithm based on the segmented fast Fourier transform is applied. The sea trials show that the system can realize the reliable UAC transmission of 100 b/s-1 kb/s in the distance of 5-8 km in the shallow water area.

TI WoMA: An Input-Based Learning Model to Predict Dynamic Workload of
   Embedded Applications
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Embedded systems; frequency scaling; machine learning
AB Embedded applications often have real-time requirements and thus meeting the user-specified deadline are essential for good user experience. Frequency (down) scaling is a widely used technique to improve energy efficiency but may lead to violations of the user-specified deadline. Thus, a workload prediction model is of critical importance to guide the frequency scaling. In this letter, we propose WoMA, a supervised learning model to predict dynamic workload (execution cycles) of embedded applications based on their input data. WoMA is built on our key observation that the workload of some embedded applications is primarily determined by their input size. Using the "input size" as features, we apply a logistic regression method to construct WoMA trained and tested using five popular embedded applications: 1) adpcm; 2) aes; 3) dfsin; 4) blowfish; and 5) gsm. Since frequency scaling is typically performed at discrete levels, for each application, we classify its workload into five distinct classes. For a given test input, WoMA will predict the class of its corresponding workload. Cycle-accurate simulation results show that 100% of WoMA predictions are accurate. Thus, we use WoMA to guide frequency scaling, resulting in power saving by 9.9%-61.8% across these benchmark applications.

AB With the emergence of Internet of Things, embedded devices are increasingly the target of software attacks. The aim of these attacks is to maliciously modify the behavior of the software being executed by the device. The work presented in this letter has been developed for the Cyber Security Awareness Week Embedded Security Challenge. This contest focuses on memory corruption issues, such as stack overflow vulnerabilities. These low level vulnerabilities are the result of code errors. Once exploited, they allow an attacker to write arbitrary data in memory without limitations. We detail in this letter a hardware-based countermeasure against return address corruption in the processor stack. First, several exploitation techniques targeting stack return addresses are discussed, whereas a lightweight hardware countermeasure is proposed and validated on the OpenRISC core. The countermeasure presented follows the shadow stack concept with a minimal hardware modification of the targeted core and an easy integration at the application level.

AB For more than two decades, memory safety violations and control-flow integrity attacks have been a prominent threat to the security of computer systems. Contrary to regular systems that are updated regularly, application-constrained devices typically run monolithic firmware that may not be updated in the lifetime of the device after being deployed in the field. Hence, the need for protections against memory corruption becomes even more prominent. In this letter, we survey memory safety in the context of embedded processors, and describe different attacks that can subvert the legitimate control flow, with a special focus on return oriented programming. Based on common attack trends, we formulate the anatomy of typical memory corruption attacks and discuss powerful mitigation techniques that have been reported in the literature.

DE Accelerators; real-time systems; reconfigurable computing; timing
   analysis; worst-case execution time (WCET)
AB Real-time systems have an increasing demand for predictable performance. Only recently novel models and analyses were proposed that make the performance benefits of runtime-reconfigurable architectures accessible for optimized worst-case execution time (WCET) guarantees. However, the implicit assumption in these works is that the process of reconfiguration itself complies with execution time guarantees. The realization of a reconfiguration controller that fulfills these assumptions and that is amenable to WCET guarantees is so far unavailable. In this letter, we detail the challenges of runtime reconfiguration in real-time systems and show that conflicts while accessing a shared main memory during reconfiguration can lead to a slowdown of more than 21x in reconfiguration bandwidth. We present concepts that enable runtime reconfiguration under WCET guarantees and release our implementation of these concepts as open source.

AB Computational complexity of public key cryptography over sensor nodes is not anymore a blocking concern in modern devices which natively (and efficiently) support elliptic curve cryptography. The problem has rather shifted toward the significant airtime consumption required to exchange multiple messages and certificates so as to perform authentication and key agreement. This letter addresses such problem by exploiting implicit certificates (elliptic curve Qu-Vanstone). We specifically propose a novel key management protocol (KMP) which suitably integrates implicit certificates with a standard elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman exchange, and performs authentication and key derivation. As confirmed by a proof-of-concept implementation and relevant experimental results, the proposed KMP guarantees maximal airtime savings (up to 86.7%) with respect to conventional approaches, robust key negotiation, fast rekeying, and efficient protection against replay attacks.

AB The design of secure circuits in emerging technologies is an appealing area that requires new efforts and attention as an effective solution to secure applications with power constraints. This letter deals with the optimized design of differential power analysis (DPA)-resilient hiding-based techniques, using tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs). Specifically, proposed TFET implementations of dual-precharge-logic primitives optimizing their computation tree in three different ways are applied to the design of the PRIDE 4-bit substitution box, the most vulnerable block of the PRIDE lightweight cipher. The performance of simulation-based DPA attacks on the proposals has shown spectacular results in security gain (34 out of 48 attacks fail for optimized computation trees in TFET technology) and power reduction (x25), compared to their CMOS-based counterparts in 65 nm, which is a significant advance in the development of secure circuits with TFETs.

AB A novel design of an embedded cardiorespiratory monitoring system for wheelchair users is proposed. The entire system is composed of a sensor node, a smartphone, and a cloud server. The sensor node contains two parts of an ultra-wideband pulse radar and the data processing module; the former is used to obtain continuous vital-sign signals, and the latter processes the sampled signals to estimate the heart rate and the respiration rate, implemented in an embedded system to achieve a fully integrated radar system. The smartphone functions as the data bridge between the sensor node and the cloud server, which is responsible for sending emergent messages. Experiment results show that the proposed system could work reliably in static and dynamic cases of wheelchairs.

AB The graphical processing unit (GPU), as a digital signal processing accelerator for cloud RAN, is investigated. This letter presents a new design for a 5G NR low-density parity check code decoder running on a GPU. The algorithm is flexibly adaptable to GPU architecture to achieve high resource utilization as well as low latency. It improves on the layered algorithm by increasing parallelism on a single code word. The flexible GPU decoder (on a 24 core GPU) was found to have 5x higher throughput compared to a recent GPU flooding decoder and 3x higher throughput compared to a field programmable gate array (FPGA) decoder (757K gate). The flexible GPU decoder exhibits 1/3 decoding power efficiency of the FPGA typical of general-purpose processors. For rapid deployment and flexibility, GPUs may be suitable as cloud RAN accelerators.

   Companies; Cryptography; Hardware; Design automa; hardware; watermarking
AB Field programmable gate array (FPGA) bitstreams contain information on the functionality of all hardware intellectual property (IP) cores used in a given design, so if an attacker gains access to the bitstream, they can mount attacks on the IP. Various mechanisms have been proposed to protect IP from reverse engineering and theft. However, there are no examples of IP obfuscation in FPGA bitstreams that also intrinsically enable tamper detection and authentication at no additional hardware cost. In this letter, we propose a mutable architecture-based watermarking scheme called WATERMARCH, a novel technique of authenticated obfuscation utilizing a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) to cryptographically mesh the obfuscation and watermark with the original design, with no additional overhead beyond the underlying obfuscation method. While collaboration between the IP owner and FPGA vendor is necessary to facilitate parsing of the bitstream, once the bitstream is parsable, the watermark can be extracted to prove authorship of the IP or confirm the presence of malicious IP modification, providing tremendous benefits to both IP owners and end users.

AB This letter proposes a novel partial pattern classification system that uses local binary patterns as a classifier and a content-addressable memory, which has the parallel search capability, to perform classification at a higher speed. The proposed pattern classification system uses Manhattan distance for class assignment and further uses logical resources on the Xilinx Virtex-7 field-programmable gate array to perform classification. Our proposed system assigns a class to a pattern of any size and shape in as less as 1.12 mu s, which is 33% faster than the state-of-the-art pattern classification system.

AB As frequently buying, programming, testing, and utilizing new programmable logic controllers (PLCs) is cost and time prohibitive, many factories utilize legacy systems which are potentially insecure. This letter presents a PLC error detection and correction technique utilizing shifted time redundancy, enabled by a full crossbar connection network. It aims to successfully detect, isolate, and mitigate cybersecurity attacks and faults in PLC devices in a factory setting where multiple parallel assembly lines complete the same task. A trust scoring system is utilized in order to rate each PLC's trustworthiness and reduces necessary overhead.

AB Instruction set simulators (ISSs) play a critical role in the design cycle of embedded systems. However, as ISSs evolve and increase in complexity, not only new bugs might be introduced but also old latent bugs might be revealed. Finding these bugs based on the simulator output might be a challenging task. This letter presents HybridVerifier, a novel and retargetable framework for ISS verification. It relies on hybrid simulation between the ISS and the host processor (x86), using the host's memory as a reference for the simulated architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in three different scenarios: 1) ISS model verification; 2) processor specific libraries/functionalities; and 3) cross compiler bugs.

DE Full system simulation; H.264 video decoder; network-on-chip (NoC)
AB We present a full system simulation framework for a network-on-chip (NoC)-based H. 264 video decoder. By combining both the communication, i.e., the NoC and the processing, i.e., H. 264 modules, components into the same simulation framework, we present for the first time the capability of simulating NoCs exercised with truly real traffic. Such a simulator can be utilized to evaluate performance metrics of systems-on-chip where the communication is done via NoCs, which are predicted to be the future communication paradigm of such systems. Because the NoC is exercised with real traffic instead of synthetic traffic such evaluations and optimizations can be more accurate and can lead to better design solutions.

AB Human motion is a vital parameter signaling indoor occupancy in occupant-centric building energy management systems. In this letter, a WiFi-based device-free sensing model employing ESP32-a low-cost embedded Internet of Things device, is proposed as a suitable retrofit for human motion sensing in new and existing buildings. A low complexity feature set derived from WiFi received signal strength indicator and channel state information samples collected by ESP32 is utilized for training ensemble machine learning models. The proposed model shows an accuracy of up to 99.4% in classifying human motion in three different rooms of a residential building, with a single WiFi access point. The proposed model can be employed for motion-driven smart load control and for a typical residential occupancy scenario, this approach exhibits a potential monthly electricity savings of up to 66.26% and a three times reduction in CO2 emissions.

DE 3-D NAND flash reliability; data refresh; word-line (WL) interference
ID RETENTION
AB As the storage density of 3-D NAND flash memory increases, reliability issues become a bottleneck. Among all reliability issues, decreased retention time is the dominant one. To extend the retention time, data refresh is a straightforward approach. However, refresh operations introduce redundant operations, which hurt the performance of the 3-D NAND flash system. With the observation that retention time can be extended by wordline (WL) interference, this letter first proposes to extend retention time with WL interference practically, and then presents a refresh scheme, which refreshes only one-third of pages in a block and postpones the refresh on the remaining two-thirds of pages with WI. The evaluation results show that the refresh operations are reduced by 40.7% at most. Compared with previous work, the read and write response times are decreased by 31.2% and 43.5%, respectively, with a 7-day refresh period.

AB In this letter, a low-power 1-bit full-adder (FA) cell is proposed based on the transmission gate (TG) to attain a special module for generating full-swing Carry output. The cell benefits from the high driving capability for both Sum and Carry outputs when embedding in multistage structures like ripple-carry adders (RCAs), compressors, and multipliers. The proposed TG-based FA has a total die area of 60.02 mu m(2), while the average power, delay, and power-delay-product (PDP) are 10.829 mu W, 3.1954 ns, and 34.603 fJ, respectively. The results introduce the FA cell as an efficient gate for integrated circuits (ICs).

AB Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) are constantly evolving in terms of hardware, power consumption, and speed. One disadvantage of these emulated TCAMs is its poor update-latency. Traditional FPGA-based TCAMs have an update-latency of N clock cycles compared to the lookup-latency of one clock cycle, where N is the depth of TCAM. Later, the update-latency is improved to t clock cycles, where t is the number of don't care bits. In this letter, we presented two mechanisms for updating FPGA-based TCAM and successfully implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA: an accelerated MUX-Update mechanism and a cost-effective LUT-Update mechanism. MUX-Update provides an update-latency of W + 1 clock cycles by using only three input/output (I/O) pins, whereas W is the width of TCAM. LUT-Update yields a constant update-latency of 2 clock cycles, independent of the size of TCAM, by using W I/O pins.

DE Blocking threads; real-time scheduling; response time analysis (RTA)
ID RESPONSE-TIME ANALYSIS; PRIORITY
AB Real-time systems usually consist of a set of interdependent periodic and sporadic threads. Scheduling theory has modeled thus far this interdependency with semaphores with priority protocols (inheritance/ceiling). However, RTOS services are far more comprehensive, including message queues, sleeps, counting semaphores, etc. This letter presents a novel scheduling theory based on response time analysis (RTA) to determine the schedulability of periodic or sporadic threads that can be blocked/suspended for a specified maximum amount of time under a fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduler.

TI Building Relationships: Using Embedded Plug Load Sensors for Occupant
   Network Inference
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Building occupants; buildings; inference algorithms; social networks
AB Understanding the underlying structure of building occupant dynamics is crucial to improving the effectiveness and energy efficiency of commercial buildings, as occupants fundamentally drive building design and operation. In current practice, we largely account for occupant behavior in the design and management of buildings through rudimentary schedules of presence or absence. However, the increasing availability of embedded sensors-such as plug load sensors-offers an opportunity not only to monitor occupants' activity patterns but also to use these patterns to gain insight into the network structure of occupants. In this letter, we present a statistical methodology for inferring this network, which comprises social, spatial, and organizational ties among occupants. We apply our method to a 7-person office environment in Northern California, and we compare the inferred networks to ground truth social, spatial, and organizational networks obtained through validated survey questions. We demonstrate that this approach offers insights into the complex nature of occupant dynamics, which can ultimately serve as inputs into building design strategies that minimize energy consumption and improve occupant well-being.

AB This letter proposes an effective speed-up estimation method for modern mobile devices. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed method uses a task graph to extract multiple parallelizable fractions of real-world mobile scenarios. Then, it uses the extracted parallelizable fractions to estimate the theoretical maximum speed-up of mobile devices. In experiments, the proposed method estimated the maximum speed-up of mobile devices more accurately than the state-of-the-art speed-up estimation method.

AB Static random-access memory (SRAM)-based ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), an alternative to traditional TCAM, where inclusion of SRAM improves the memory access speed, scalability, cost, and storage density compared to conventional TCAM. In order to confidently use the SRAM-based TCAMs in application, an update module (UM) is essential. The UM replaces the old TCAM contents with fresh contents. This letter proposes a fast update mechanism for an SRAM-based TCAM and implements it on Xilinx Virtex-6 field-programmable gate array. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first ever proposal on content-update-module in an SRAM-based TCAM, which consumes least possible clock cycles to update a TCAM word.

DE Approximate computing; high-level synthesis
AB Approximate computing (AC) obtains performance or energy gains by trading off computational accuracy in error-tolerant applications. At the hardware level, AC-aware high-level synthesis tools apply operation-level approximations to generate a quality-reduced register-transfer level design from an accurate high-level description. While existing tools primarily target energy savings, we focus on performance optimizations. Loops are often the most performance-critical application code structures. In a loop, iterations can have different impacts on output quality due to an inherent data-dependency of approximations. Exploiting iteration-wise data variations, we present a novel technique that clusters iterations according to data statistics and applies different approximations in each cluster to maximize performance gains. Performance can be improved by up to 76%, with up to 21.7% stemming from clustering.

DE Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT); realtime embedded convex optimization solver
AB With the increasing sophistication in the use of optimization algorithms such as deep learning on embedded systems, the convex optimization solvers on embedded systems have found widespread use. This letter presents a novel linear solver technique to reduce the run-time of convex optimization solver by using the property that some parameters are fixed during the solution iterations of a solve instance. Our experimental results show that the run-time can be reduced by two orders of magnitude.

AB Software bugs are a critical threat to the deployability and maintainability of low-power wireless sensors, resulting in excess power consumption, hardware misconfigurations, incorrect data, and shortened device lifetimes. Worse, these errors can prevent wireless reprogramming, resulting in longer delays and costly human interventions. This letter describes shoulder angel-an ultra-low-power, low-cost, open hardware and software platform that ensures users can always recover and reprogram wireless sensors, in spite of software errors. Shoulder angel uses a physically separate coprocessor to monitor a device's power consumption and other behaviors, while keeping the device in a reprogrammable state. Our results show that shoulder angel is able to recover from otherwise fatal software errors while incurring an energy overhead of only 7 mu W.

AB Deflection routing has benefits that may make it attractive especially when inexpensive network-on-chip (NoC) implementations are considered. In this letter, we present a proposal of deflection routing in hierarchical mesh NoCs. An evaluation of performance and power, obtained with a cycle accurate simulator and using both synthetic and application benchmarks, is reported. We introduce interleaving and shifting, two techniques that reduce the number of routers with a high radix crossbar without reducing network performance.

AB During the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wearable IoT (WIoT) health devices have become essential resources for remote monitoring of the main physiological signs affected by this disease. As well as sensors, microprocessor, and wireless communication elements are widely studied, the power supply unit has the same importance for the WIoT technology, since the autonomy of the system between recharges is of great importance. This letter presents the design of the power supply system of a WIoT device capable of monitoring oxygen saturation and body temperature, sending the collected data to an IoT platform. The supply system is based on a three-stage block consisting of a rechargeable battery, battery charge controller, and dc voltage converter. The power supply system is designed and implemented as a prototype in order to test performance and efficiency. The results show that the designed block provides a stable supply voltage avoiding energy losses, which makes it an efficient and rapidly developing system.

AB This work presents a lightweight, FPGA-based hardware implementation for polynomial multiplication, which is the major bottleneck in the NTRU public-key cryptographic scheme. NTRU is a quantum-resilient, lattice-based key exchange cryptosystem, and is currently a finalist in the ongoing National Institute of Standards and Technology post-quantum cryptography standardization. It is challenging to fit these quantum resilient schemes into Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes due to the strict resource constraints (smaller area, less memory, and lower energy budgets) and the limited computational capabilities in embedded devices. We undertake this compact implementation for polynomial multiplication with two motivations: 1) constant time implementation ensuring inherent security against timing side-channel attacks and 2) optimized hardware consumption to make it suitable for IoT applications. A single-step multiplexer based iterative architecture is proposed to achieve both goals simultaneously. Compared to the architectures presented in the literature, our proposed work eliminates the utilization of a modular arithmetic unit and replaces it with the correct selection of input followed by an accumulator, which can help to save substantial device resources. Experimental results with an FPGA show that our proposed architecture achieves an area reduction of up to 2.86x and the throughput increase up to 1.23x compared to the state-of-the-art implementation strategies, providing comparable latency along with an inherent-timing attack resilience that is absent in several NTRU hardware implementation schemes.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB As technology scales down, power density considerably increases, raising critical power and thermal challenges. This is even more challenging for mobile devices due to their form factor and the multiple sources of thermal emergencies, as well as the limited electric current delivery, arising from battery specifications. In this letter, we propose a cascaded thermal and electrical current throttling controller inspired from the physical relations that exist among the different current and thermal measures. The proposed controller achieves better results by coordinating between the different sources of current and thermal emergencies, and dynamically adjusting their caps. Testing on a state-of-the-art smartphone, the proposed technique achieves 6.5% better performance and 18% power savings as compared to the existing techniques, while avoiding current and thermal violations using 40x less DVFS transitions.

AB GPS technology has revolutionized the way we localize and navigate outdoors. However, the poor reception of GPS signals in buildings makes it unsuitable for indoor localization. WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization is one of the most promising ways to meet this demand. Unfortunately, most work in the domain fails to resolve challenges associated with deployability on resource-limited embedded devices. In this work, we propose a compression-aware and high-accuracy deep learning framework called CHISEL that outperforms the best-known works in the area while maintaining localization robustness on embedded devices.

AB In this letter, we study the problem of designing multicomponent branch predictors for low-resource embedded systems. The highlight of our design is a shared pattern history table with a tiny dealiasing cache for intercomponent interference resolution. Experiments on the CBP-5 traces are shown to record the performance in terms of prediction accuracy. Synthesis results generated using the Synopsys design compiler with TSMC 90-nm libraries confirm the area and power benefits of our design.

DE Chip multiprocessors (CMPs); contention-aware scheduling; dynamic

AB Mobile and embedded devices have adopted the clustered multiprocessing architecture paradigm in order to serve the increasing workload demands and control/reduce their power consumption. Cores of the same type are integrated into clusters and cluster-wide voltage/frequency scaling mechanisms help them operate under specific power constraints. In this letter, we propose a methodology that: 1) enhances performance by addressing contention on shared resources of the cluster and 2) pro-actively predicts the maximum frequency under which the cluster should operate in order to meet a user-defined power threshold. Experimental results on an Odroid-XU3 board show that the proposed methodology meets the power thresholds, achieving at the same time high performance. Particularly for 7-W threshold, it achieved 5% performance gain over Linux which at the same time consumed 8-W approximately.

AB Multicore power, area, and timing (McPAT) is one of the popular system-level simulators that can evaluate power either in design space explorations (DSEs) or in run-time applications. However, when estimating the dynamic power of a processor, the inputs of McPAT are microarchitecture statistics captured from cycle-accurate simulations, which usually are unacceptably time-consuming. In this letter, we propose an accelerated McPAT power simulator (AMPS) without any cycle-accurate simulations. The statistics are analytically modeled using micro-architecture independent characteristics of the application (MICA) that extracted from the trace profiling. AMPS is verified under the SPEC2006 benchmark suite. The average error of power evaluation using AMPS is 4.96% relative to that based on the simulation statistics from gem5. Meanwhile, the evaluation time can be sped up by 9.76 times compared with the approach of accurate simulation inputs.

AB A novel algorithm is proposed to compute the median of a running window of m integers in O(Ig Ig m) time. For a new window, the new median value is computed as a simple decision based on the previous median, and the values removed and inserted into the window. This facilitates implementations based on data structures that support fast ordinal predecessor/successor operations. The results show accelerations of up to factors of six for integer data streaming in typical embedded processors.

TI FIFA: Exploring a Focally Induced Fault Attack Strategy in

SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

AB In this letter, we explore the emerging security threats of near-threshold computing (NTC). Researchers have shown that the delay sensitivity of a circuit to supply voltage variation tremendously increases, as the circuit's operating conditions shift from traditional super-threshold values to NTC values. As a result, NTC systems become extremely vulnerable to timing fault attacks, jeopardizing trustworthy computing. Inspired by the operation of a polymorphic virus, we propose a novel threat model for NTC, referred to as a focally induced fault attack (FIFA). FIFA employs a machine learning framework to ascertain the circuit vulnerabilities and generates targeted software modules to cause a breach of end-user privacy. Our experimental results, obtained from a rigorous machine learning approach, indicate the efficacy of FIFA, in a low-power mobile platform.

AB Although the read disturb spin-transfer torque RAM approximation technique improves performance, it may consist of an approximate read plus an approximate write both at the same time. So it may degrade the application quality of result (QoR) considerably. On the other hand, the incorrect read decision approximation technique improves power without corrupting the stored data. We adopt an opportunity study for instruction-based distinction of read implementation to take advantage of both of the approximation techniques, while enhancing application's QoR. We evaluated the proposed method using a set of state-of- the-art benchmarks. The experimental results show that our method allows to increase application's QoR substantially (i.e., by up to about 24 dB) compared to QoR-oblivious use of the read approximation techniques.

AB Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are readily affected by transient faults in the presence of radiation and other environmental hazards compared to application specific integrated circuits. Hence, error mitigation and recovery techniques are necessary to protect the FPGA hardware from soft errors arising from transient faults. In this letter, modified matrix code (MMC) is used for multibit error correction in FPGA-based systems, and dynamic partial reconfiguration is considered to reduce the reconfiguration time. We propose a first of its kind methodology for novel transient fault correction using MMC for FPGAs. To validate the design, the proposed method has been tested on a Kintex FPGA and its performance has been estimated in terms of hardware complexity, power consumption, overhead, and error correction efficiency.

AB Security plays a vital role in electronic communication, particularly in wireless networks like long term evolution (LTE), where safeguarding data and resources from malicious activities is crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are at the core of security mechanisms, ensuring the protection of sensitive information. While software implementations of these algorithms are relatively straightforward, they often need more speed in real-time applications for communication devices like mobile phones. Consequently, implementation of these cryptographic algorithms as hardware crypto processors becomes necessary. This letter presents a novel implementation of the SNOW3G crypto processor architecture for the 4G LTE security applications, focusing on area, power, and efficiency. The proposed modified SNOW3G architecture utilizes only 0.31% of the available area when implemented on an FPGA Zynq ZC702 and achieves 28.34 efficiency which quantifies as the ratio of throughput to the area. Furthermore, it consumes a total power of 0.142 mW. These low power and area requirements make the design highly suitable for integration into mobile devices, meeting their specific constraints and enabling efficient cryptographic operations.

TI Efficient Partial Weight Update Techniques for Lightweight On-Device
   Learning on Tiny Flash-Embedded MCUs
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Artificial neural networks; embedded software; flash memories;
   microcontrollers
AB Typical training procedures involve read and write operations for weight updates during backpropagation. However, on-device training on microcontroller units (MCUs) presents two challenges. First, the on-chip SRAM has insufficient capacity to store the weight. Second, the large flash memory, which has a constraint on write access, becomes necessary to accommodate the network for on-device training on MCUs. To tackle these memory constraints, we propose a partial weight update technique based on gradient delta computation. The weights are stored in flash memory, and a part of the weight to be updated is selectively copied to the SRAM from the flash memory. We implemented this approach for training a fully connected network on an on-device MNIST digit classification task using only 20-kB SRAM and 1912-kB flash memory on an MCU. The proposed technique achieves reasonable accuracy with only 18.52% partial weight updates, which is comparable to state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we achieved a reduction of up to 46.9% in the area-power-delay product compared to a commercially available high-performance MCU capable of embedding the entire model parameter, taking into account the area scale factor.

AB Global warming effects are seen around the world and Latin American countries are not an exception, especially for expanding drought areas. Therefore, underground water resources used in the region are incrementing exponentially. However, temporal and spatial underground water information concerning availability and quality is scarce, disabling proper decision making. In order to close that breach, we propose and embedded edge-processing Internet of Things (IoT)-based water quality monitoring system. This letter introduces the design and implementation of this solution, specifically targeted to monitor irrigation and drinking water extracted from water wells. The system is designed to be deployed in central Chile, considering the topographic conditions, which severely affect power availability and communication resources. The captured data are stored in a data lake, for further processing according to water quality models.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative, privacy-preserving method for training deep neural networks at the edge of the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the many advantages, existing FL implementations suffer high communication costs that prevent adoption at scale. Specifically, the frequent model updates between the central server and the many end nodes are a source of channel congestion and high energy consumption. This letter tackles this aspect by introducing federated learning with gradual layer freezing (FedGLF), a novel FL scheme that gradually reduces the portion of the model sent back and forth, relieving the communication bundle yet preserving the quality of the training service. The results collected on two image classification tasks learned with different data distributions prove that FedGLF outperforms conventional FL schemes, with data volume savings ranging from 14% to 59% or up to 2.5% higher accuracy.

AB Binocular vision and neural networks (CNNs) are widely seen in modern intelligent vision processing systems, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and AR gadgets. However, both the classic semiglobal matching (SGM) and deep CNNs entail substantial computing resource to reach the performance goal. Traditional embedded CPU/graphic processor unit (GPU) cannot simultaneously meet the processing speed and energy requirement, while the specialized circuits dedicated to SGM and CNN processing, respectively, will take considerable hardware and development costs. However, as the popularity of deep learning, neural processing units (NPUs) become prevalent in many embedded and edge devices, which possess high throughput computing power to deal with the matrix operations involved by neural networks. In this work, we attempt to take advantage of the neural processing architectures integrated in SoC chips to accelerate the SGM process, so that the hardware resources will be better utilized instead of investing more resources to create specialized SGM components. Thereby, this letter first deploys SGM on NPU by converting the incompatible operations into the neural-computing flow, and a configurable neural processing element is proposed to flexibly support various vector operation sequences. Then, a hybrid dataflow scheduler and the corresponding hardware modification are introduced to accelerate the cost processing, improving hardware utilization and on-chip memory footprint and access. Our solution runs at 45 fps for an image size of $640\times 480$ , with 128 disparity levels. The speed-energy efficiency is $52\times $ better than the GPU (Jetson TX1) solution with negligible additional hardware overhead and accuracy loss.

AB IoT systems are used for performing a variety of essential tasks in wide-ranging sectors, such as healthcare, smart cities, agriculture, and industrial automation. Most of these systems incorporate smartness for intelligent decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. To reduce the network bandwidth usage and load on the cloud server, there is a push to relegate most of these AI-related computations to edge IoT devices/systems. Hence, to ensure good performance, the edge devices must be systematically designed with an emphasis on the respective AI requirements from exploration to deployment. State-of-the-art IoT device and system design practices place little importance on the AI specifications during the early stages of the system development resulting in systems, which are unable to meet the AI specifications without additional redesigning and optimization efforts. In this letter, we propose an automated framework for AI-rooted IoT system design approach, where the AI specifications play a vital role in deciding the system components, design, and implementation from a very early stage of the design life cycle. The proposed framework employs an expert system and a machine-readable knowledge-base to automate the design process. Using a set of case studies, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.

DE Compliance testing (CT); control and status register (CSR); reduced
   instruction set computer (RISC)-V
AB Recently, the critical compliance testing (CT) problem for reduced instruction set computer (RISC)-V has received significant attention. However, control and status registers (CSRs), which form the backbone of the RISC-V privileged architecture specification, have been mostly neglected in the CT effort so far. In this letter, we first analyze the RISC-V privileged architecture specification in detail to group the CSRs into different classes according to their functionality. Based on the classes and additional common CSR characteristics, we come up with a set of fundamental CSR tests. These partly automatically generated CSR tests allow to check the compliance of RISC-V simulators and cores. We found several unknown errors in numerous RISC-V simulators. The results demonstrate the necessity for extensive CSR testing to ensure compliance with the RISC-V specification.

   Thermal Throttling
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Frame rate janks; interactive performance; mobile devices; thermal
   management
AB Mobile devices are limited in mass and volume, reducing the viability of active device cooling implementations. This requires the use of less effective passive techniques to maintain device skin temperature levels. Application performance demands on a modern mobile device are driven by sustained performance workloads, such as 3-D games, virtual, and augmented reality. Mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) have corresponding increases in performance through both architectural changes and frequency of operation increases, which has resulted in the peak power consumption exceeding the sustainable thermal envelope defined by device skin temperature requirements. Existing thermal throttling techniques mitigate this by capping the frequency of operation of the SoC. Through experimentation with a modern smartphone platform using sequences from real-world applications, we demonstrate in this letter that frequency capping (FC) can have a significant effect on the performance of interactive applications, increasing the number of frame rate defects by up to 146%. We propose task utilization scaling, a new lever for thermal throttling, which scales performance for critical interactive periods by the same factor as noncritical periods. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can result in a decrease in frame rate defects of up to 18% compared with FC or a skin temperature reduction of up to 2 degrees C.

TI Making Sensor Node Virtual Machines Work for Real-World Applications

AB A large number of virtual machines (VMs) have been developed for sensor nodes. Many are based on Java, although implementations based on Python and. Net also exist. Some aspects of the java virtual machine, such as the simple yet sufficiently expressive instruction set, work well on a sensor node. However, Java was developed for more powerful devices, which results in certain functionality not being ideal for resource constrained devices. While writing VM implementations and programmes to run on sensor node devices over the past decade, we encountered a number of situations where this mismatch between standard languages and the specifics of sensor node programming limited the practical use of current VMs. In this letter, we describe what we consider to be the most pressing issues and discuss how these may be resolved in future VMs.

TI NVALT: Nonvolatile Approximate Lookup Table for GPU Acceleration

DE Approximate computing; content addressable memory; general public
   utilities (GPUs); nonvolatile memory
AB In this letter, we design a nonvolatile approximate lookup table, called NVALT, to significantly accelerate general public utilities (GPUs) computation. Our design stores high frequency input patterns within an approximate NVALT to model each application's functionality. NVALT searches for and returns the stored data best matching the input data to produce an approximate output. We define a similarity metric, appropriate for binary representation, by exploiting the analog characteristics of the nonvolatile content addressable memory. Our design controls the ratio of the application running between the approximate NVALT and accurate GPU cores in order to tune the level of accuracy necessary for user requirements. Our evaluations on seven general GPU applications shows that, NVALT can improve energy computation by 4.5x and performance by 5.7x on average while providing less than 10% average relative error as compared to the baseline GPU.

DE Converged infrastructures; industrial control systems (ICS);
   virtualization
AB Modern programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are pervasive components in industrial control systems (ICSs) such as supervisory control and data acquisition, designed to control industrial processes autonomously or as part of a distributed system topology. Its success may be explained by its robustness and reliability, being one of the most enduring legacies on modern ICS, despite having evolved very little over the last years. This letter proposes an x86-based virtual PLC (vPLC) architecture that decouples the logic and control capabilities from the I/O components, while virtualizing the PLC logic within a real-time hypervisor. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, the topic of real-time virtualization for x86 platforms is analyzed, together with an evaluation study of the properties of real-time workloads in partitioned hypervisor environments.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB Emerging computer vision applications of smart camera networks (SCNs) often require that the network cameras operate under limited or unreliable power sources. Therefore in order to extend the SCN lifetime it is important to manage the energy consumption of the cameras which is related to the workload of the vision tasks they perform. Hence, by assigning vision tasks to cameras in an energy-aware manner it is possible to extend the network lifetime. In this letter, we address this problem by proposing a market-based solution where cameras bid for tasks using an adaptive utility function. The early results for different SCN configurations and scenarios indicate that the proposed methodology can increase network lifetime.

DE Multiplier; multi-precision; quantization; run-time reconfiguration
AB Recent research widely explored the quantization schemes on hardware. However, for recent accelerators only supporting 8 bits quantization, such as Google TPU, the lower-precision inputs, such as 1/2-bit quantized neural network models in FINN, need to extend the data width to meet the hardware interface requirements. This conversion influences communication and computing efficiency. To improve the flexibility and throughput of quantized multipliers, our work explores two novel reconfigurable multiplier designs that can repartition the number of input channels in runtime based on input precision and reconfigure the signed/unsigned multiplication modes. In this letter, we explored two novel runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multipliers based on the multiplier-tree and bit-serial multiplier architectures. We evaluated our designs by implementing a systolic array and single-layer neural network accelerator on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. The result shows the flexibility of our implementation and the high speedup for low-precision quantized multiplication working with a fixed data width of the hardware interface.

TI Swift-CNN: Leveraging PCM Memory’s Fast Write Mode to Accelerate CNNs
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Neural networks; phase change memory (PCM); system performance
AB Nonvolatile memories [especially phase change memories (PCMs)] offer scalability and higher density. However, reduced write performance has limited their use as main memory. Researchers have explored using the fast write mode available in PCM to alleviate the challenges. The fast write mode offers lower write latency and energy consumption. However, the fast-written data are retained for a limited time and need to be refreshed. Prior works perform fast writes when the memory is busy and use slow writes to refresh the data during memory idle phases. Such policies do not consider the retention time requirement of a variable and repeat all the writes made during the busy phase. In this work, we suggest a retention-time-aware selection of write modes. As a case study, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and present a novel algorithm, Swift-CNN, that assesses each CNN layer's memory access behavior and retention time requirement and suggests an appropriate PCM write mode. Our results show that Swift-CNN decreases inference and training execution time and memory energy compared to state-of-the-art techniques and achieves execution time close to the ideal (fast write-only) policy.

AB computing (AC) is an emerging technique in arithmetic circuits. In this letter, a new AC-based full adder (FA) circuit is presented with 12 transistors, 0.239 mu m2 of area, and two errors in the outputs. In the proposed FA, the gate diffusion input (GDI) and dynamic-threshold (DT) techniques are applied using the carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) technology. Accuracy metrics, such as normalized mean error distance (NMED) and mean relative error distance (MRED) along with circuitry parameters of power-delay-product (PDP), energy-delay-product (EDP), and power-delay-area-product (PDAP), confirm the efficiency of the proposed FA for complex structures. The proposed FA is embedded in a ripple carry adder (RCA) by various numbers of approximate bits (NABs), and then the accuracy and circuitry parameters are extracted. Compared to the state-of-the-art designs, the high-efficient behavior of the proposed FA is proved when it is used in image processing applications.

AB Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) having software-like reconfigurability and hardware-like performance are adopted as developing platforms to implement complex systems, i.e., software-defined networks (SDNs). Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is not present in modern FPGA, but rather it is used as a softcore where needed. The hardware structure of an FPGA is flexible but rigid; the elemental structure is fixed and can be used in a limited number of ways. Existing FPGA-based TCAMs exhaust one particular type of memory when a large size is implemented, resulting in a shortage of memory for the rest of the system. Our proposed architecture uses only those memory elements of FPGA that are redundant and not used by other parts. In this letter, the proposed architecture, comp-TCAM, combines both block RAM (BRAM) and lookup table RAM (LUTRAM) to implement the TCAM architecture; that eliminates the dependency on the type of memory and is adaptable to the requirement of the system. Evaluation results show the feasibility, scalability, and effectiveness of the proposed TCAM architecture compared to the existing TCAM architectures. The hardware resource utilization on Xilinx VIrtex-7 FPGA is reduced by 41.6% compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TCAM with no harm to the system's performance providing a throughput of 21.06 Gbits/s.

AB Estimating the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring that the batteries operate safely and have a long lifespan. The existing approaches for SOH estimation on embedded systems only consider one health indicator (HI) to represent either capacity or internal resistance (IR) behavior because of limitations in the hardware devices. Nevertheless, both capacity and IR provide valuable battery health information and neither of these could be neglected. Hence, we propose the SOH estimation method that can consider both capacity degradation and IR growth by representing it with HIs that can be directly measured in embedded systems with less complex computation. The results reveal that the proposed method improves the estimation accuracy by at least 47.59% and reduced the inference time by an average of 29.20%. All tests are performed on an actual embedded system using several datasets to demonstrate and verify both the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.

In order to support the computational demands of latency-sensitive video applications and efficiently utilize the available network resources, we present an edge-based resource management methodology for serving video processing applications in an IoT environment. In this letter, we propose a scalable solution for providing low-latency video analytics at the edge level, while maximizing the quality of service under device and network constraints. As use case, we evaluate the proposed methodology on a face detection video processing application. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology satisfies specific time thresholds, comparing to cloud-only, local-only, and other video-optimized offloading techniques, while taking into consideration the video resolution.

AB This letter proposes a novel approach to design a ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed architecture uses slice registers (SRs) for storage instead of lookup tables and static random-access memory, and a control signal in place of a memory element to accommodate a don't care state. The proposed architecture is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. Compared with the latest prior work, the proposed TCAM reduces the number of SRs by 50.04% while not compromising on throughput.

AB Energy harvesting is increasingly considered a key technology for the design of autonomous embedded systems. However, the design, deployment, and validation of systems exploiting the energy scavenged from the environment to sustain their operativeness poses considerable research challenges, especially in a networked context. Emulation is regarded as an achievable option to allow reproducible and accurate experimental conditions. However, when the emulation is carried out by means of an embedded low-power device, the trade-off between accuracy and tight time requirements has to be carefully taken into account in order to avoid performance degradation. We introduce a novel approach that aims at improving the reactiveness of a hardware-software embedded emulator thanks to the introduction of a hardware compensation circuit. The proposed system allows an efficient run-time correction of the emulated voltage to be supplied to the load, thus improving the response time of the emulator with respect to the software-based compensation.

AB Automatic generation of custom instructions is the key to the extensible processors. The generation of custom instructions includes two crucial steps: 1) custom instruction enumeration and 2) custom instruction selection. This letter focuses on the custom instruction enumeration step. Enumerating all custom instruction candidates satisfying architectural constraints from an application graph is a computationally difficult problem. Considering the high complexity of the custom instruction enumeration, we propose a simple but efficient parallel search method based on multidepth graph partitioning for enumerating custom instructions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can give near-linear speedup and outperforms the latest parallel methods.

AB This letter describes a newly established design framework with the layered architecture of processing elements (PEs) exploiting high-level synthesis and its evaluation results. The design framework was developed for intelligent sensor nodes of Internet of Things applications that collaborate with cloud systems, in which small footprint and low power consumption were major concerns. The design framework consists of four layered structure of PE architecture with the extended database management function of a high-level synthesis tool. We investigated the dependencies of resource consumption on the granularity of coarse grained function definitions using the extended database management function of CyberWorkBench. The evaluation results showed that small footprint was achieved especially with dynamically reconfigurable technique.

AB Approximate computing is an evolving paradigm that aims to improve the power, speed, and area in neural network applications that can tolerate errors up to a specific limit. This letter proposes a new multiplier architecture based on the algorithm that adapts the approximate compressor from the existing and proposed compressors' set to reduce error in the respective partial product columns. Further, the error due to the approximation in the proposed multiplier is corrected using a simple error-correcting module. Results prove that the power and power-delay product (PDP) of an 8-bit multiplier is improved by up to 39.9% and 43.6% compared with the exact multiplier and 27.5% and 23.9% compared to similar previous designs. The proposed multiplier is validated using image processing and neural network applications to prove its efficacy.

AB Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) transforms architectural optimization into a super network optimization by stacking two cells (2 c.). However, repeatedly stacking two cells is a suboptimal operation since cells in different depths should be various. Besides, we find that the performance is slightly improved by increasing the number of searched cells (e.g., from 2 c. to 5 c.), but it leads to uneven resource allocation. This letter proposes a regularized DARTS (RDARTS) to adjust the architectural differences and balance degrees of freedom and resource allocation. Specifically, we use separate architectural parameters for two reduction cells and three normal cells, and then propose an Reg distance to calculate the difference between cells. We design a new validation loss which is the weighting of cross-entropy and Reg loss and introduce an adaptive adjustment method. Results show that RDARTS achieves the top-1 accuracy of 97.64% and 75.8% on CIFAR and ImageNet.

AB Poor air quality is a global problem that affects human health and ecosystems all over the world. For that reason, many countries invest in networks of reference monitoring stations that measure air quality in real time. However, the high installation and maintenance costs of these stations mean that smaller cities or underdeveloped regions are less covered by such stations. In these regions, alternative detection technologies such as low-cost monitoring systems can be used instead. Unfortunately, the results of such monitoring devices are often questioned by academics. This contribution proposes the design of an air quality monitoring system where cost and reliability have been optimized from a hardware point of view. In addition, the device has been coupled to an IoT platform so that inexperienced users can view and share the collected information The design of affordable systems increases the ability to perform ad hoc analysis at the level of neighborhoods or cities by citizen science organizations or governmental entities.

TI Needle in a Haystack: Detecting Subtle Malicious Edits to Additive
   Manufacturing G-Code Files
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Information security; computer security; computer aided manufacturing
AB Increasing usage of digital manufacturing (DM) in safety-critical domains is increasing attention on the cybersecurity of the manufacturing process, as malicious third parties might aim to introduce defects in digital designs. In general, the DM process involves creating a digital object (as CAD files) before using a slicer program to convert the models into printing instructions (e.g., g-code) suitable for the target printer. As the g-code is an intermediate machine format, malicious edits may be difficult to detect, especially when the golden (original) models are not available to the manufacturer. In this work, we aim to quantify this hypothesis through a red team/blue team case study, whereby the red team aims to introduce subtle defects that would impact the properties (strengths) of the 3-D printed parts, and the blue team aims to detect these modifications in the absence of the golden models. The case study had two sets of models, the first with 180 designs (with two compromised using two methods) and the second with 4320 designs (with 60 compromised using six methods). Using statistical modeling and machine learning (ML), the blue team was able to detect all the compromises in the first set of data, and 50 of the compromises in the second.

AB This letter details a fast and efficient implementation of the Montgomery modular multiplication by taking advantage of parallel multipliers and adders. This implementation was programmed in high-level synthesis language and tested on a field-programmable gate array device. In order to test the performance of the proposal, a sequential version of the algorithm was also implemented in hardware. Moreover, we compared the parallel implementation with a software version and with five contributions from the literature. This way, we found that our proposal improves the performance of all other implementations.

AB As the storage density of NAND flash increases, the reliability is significantly degraded, making NAND flash memory more sensitive to noise. Among all noise sources, retention noise is a major one. Error correction based on channel parameter estimation is an essential method to deal with retention noise. In this letter, a time-saving channel parameter estimation method for TLC NAND flash memory is proposed. The proposed method reduces estimation time by three improvements: 1) reducing fitted parameters in one iteration step; 2) using prederived values as initial guess values to decrease iteration steps; and 3) utilizing parallelism between data sensing operations and computation. Compared with the previous work, the proposed method estimates parameters with higher accuracy and lower time overhead which is verified by experimental results.

AB While the accuracy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved vast improvements by introducing larger and deeper network architectures, also the memory footprint for storing their parameters and activations has increased. This trend especially challenges power- and resource-limited accelerator designs, which are often restricted to store all network data in on-chip memory to avoid interfacing energy-hungry external memories. Maximizing the network size that fits on a given accelerator thus requires to maximize its memory utilization. While the traditionally used ping-pong buffering technique is mapping subsequent activation layers to disjunctive memory regions, we propose a mapping method that allows these regions to overlap and thus utilize the memory more efficiently. This letter presents the mathematical model to compute the maximum activations memory overlap and thus the lower bound of on-chip memory needed to perform layer-by-layer processing of CNNs on memory-limited accelerators. Our experiments with various real-world object detector networks show that the proposed mapping technique can decrease the activations memory by up to 32.9%, reducing the overall memory for the entire network by up to 23.9% compared to traditional ping-pong buffering. For higher resolution denoising networks, we achieve activation memory savings of 48.8%. Additionally, we implement a face detector network on a field-programmable gate array-based camera to validate these memory savings on a complete end-to-end system.

   neural architecture search (NAS); parameter sharing
AB Deep learning has promoted remarkable progress in various tasks while the effort devoted to these hand-crafting neural networks has motivated so-called neural architecture search (NAS) to discover them automatically. Recent aging evolution (AE) automatic search algorithm turns to discard the oldest model in population and finds image classifiers beyond manual design. However, it achieves a low speed of convergence. A nonaging evolution (NAE) algorithm tends to neglect the worst architecture in population to accelerate the search process whereas it obtains a lower performance compared with AE. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose to use an optimized evolution algorithm for recurrent NAS (EvoRNAS) by setting a probability epsilon to remove the worst or oldest model in population alternatively, which can balance the performance and time length. Besides, parameter sharing mechanism is introduced in our approach due to the heavy cost of evaluating the candidate models in both AE and NAE. Furthermore, we train the sharing parameters only once instead of many epochs like ENAS, which makes the evaluation of candidate models faster. On Penn Treebank, we first explore different epsilon in EvoRNAS and find the best value suited for the learning task, which is also better than AE and NAE. Second, the optimal cell found by EvoRNAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance within only 0.6 GPU hours, which is 20 x and 40 x faster than ENAS and DARTS. Moreover, the transferability of the learned architecture to WikiText-2 also shows strong performance compared with ENAS or DARTS.

AB As different batteries exhibit their own advantages and disadvantages, a single-type battery system for a mobile embedded system (such as smartphones and tablet PC) cannot overcome the inherent limitations of its target battery. For example, although the lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) battery is the most popular battery for mobile embedded systems due to its high energy density, mobile embedded systems equipped with LCO batteries suffer from rapid capacity degradation. In this letter, we target heterogeneous batteries in a mobile embedded system and propose a method for minimizing the capacity degradation of the batteries. To this end, we first analyze factors that affect capacity degradation, and choose dominant factors that are controllable in a mobile embedded system. We then build a battery degradation model considering the factors, and finally develop a battery scheduling algorithm that minimizes capacity degradation using the degradation model. Our evaluation with real experiments and simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in minimizing capacity degradation.

AB As the industrial cyber-infrastructure become increasingly important to realize the objectives of Industry 4.0, the consequence of disruption due to internal or external faults become increasingly severe. Thus there is a need for a resilient infrastructure. In this letter, we propose a contract-based methodology where components across layers of the cyber-infrastructure are associated with contracts and a light-weight resilience manager. This allows the system to detect faults (contract violation monitored using observers) and react (change contracts dynamically) effectively.

AB A voltage-scalable SRAM architecture suitable for video applications where energy can be traded with output signal quality is presented. The proposed 6T SRAM architecture uses three supply voltages to improve the static noise margin during read and write modes and also reduces leakage current in retention mode, hence, it allows aggressive supply voltage scaling for low power multimedia applications. Simulation results in IBM/Global Foundries cmos32soi 32-nm CMOS technology show a 69% power saving and a 63% improvement in image quality for the proposed array compared to a conventional single-supply 64-kB 6T SRAM at 0.70 V, 20 MHz. The proposed design also allows a dynamic power-quality tradeoff at run time and makes the 6T SRAM array a suitable power efficient memory for different video/image applications.

AB Buildings are immensely energy-demanding and are expected to consume even more in the near future. The operation of cooling/heating mechanisms highly contribute to this parameter, since nonoptimal configuration at temperature set-points usually leads to increased energy cost, as well as violations at occupant's thermal comfort. In this letter, we introduce a flexible decision-making mechanism for supporting the proper configuration of these devices. The competitive advantage of our solution is the remarkable lower computational complexity without any degradation at the quality of derived decisions.

AB Recently, brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) becomes an emerging computational scheme that has achieved success in various domains, such as human activity recognition, voice recognition, and bio-medical signal classification. HDC mimics the brain cognition and leverages high-dimensional vectors (e.g., 10 000 dimensions) with fully distributed holographic representation and (pseudo-)randomness. Ensemble learning is a classical learning method utilizing a group of weak learners to form a strong learner, which aims to increase the accuracy of the model. This letter presents a systematic effort in exploring ensemble learning in the context of HDC and proposes an ensemble HDC model referred to as EnHDC. EnHDC uses a majority voting-based mechanism to synergistically integrate the prediction outcomes of multiple base HDC classifiers. To enhance the diversity of base classifiers, we vary the encoding mechanisms, dimensions, and data width settings among base classifiers. By applying EnHDC on a wide range of applications, results show that EnHDC can achieve on average 3.2% accuracy improvement over a single HDC classifier. Further, we show that EnHDC with reduced dimensionality can achieve similar or even surpass the accuracy of baseline HDC with higher dimensionality. This leads to a 20% reduction of storage requirement of the HDC model, which can enhance the efficiency of HDC enabled on low-power computing platforms.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) hardware accelerators are being deployed widely to accelerate the inference process. Security of such accelerators is a major challenge, especially when being deployed in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. In this letter, we present novel Hardware Trojan (HT) attacks on two DNN hardware accelerators, which modifies the activation parameters of the DNN in a field-programmable gate array-based accelerator implementation. The proposed HT is agnostic to the detailed architecture of the DNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HT is extremely stealthy, and when activated can result in significant degradation in inference accuracy.

AB Discarded consumer electronics are a significant and growing source of hazardous waste. Repurposing smartphones has the potential to reduce the rate of disposal. However, reusing smartphones for general computational tasks is difficult due to the variety and domain specificity of the mobile software stack, and the relatively low computational power of these devices. We present the design and proof-of-concept implementation of Renee, a smartphone-based cluster built from used phones that provides function-as-a-service (FaaS) capabilities. Our experience indicates that reusing decommissioned smartphones for general computational tasks is not only feasible but also that a local cluster built from these devices has the potential to provide faster response times than commercial FaaS while reducing the yearly global warming potential of the reused devices.

AB Computation has been pushed to the edge to decrease latency and alleviate the computational burden of the IoT applications in the cloud. However, the increasing processing demands of edge applications make necessary the employment of platforms that exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP). Yet, power and heat dissipation rise as TLP inadvertently increases or when parallelism is not cleverly exploited, which may be the result of the nonideal use of a given parallel program interface (PPI). Besides the common issues, such as the need for more robust power sources and better cooling, heat also adversely affects aging, accelerating phenomenons, such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot-carrier injection (HCI), which further reduces processor lifetime. Hence, considering that increasing the lifespan of an edge device is key, so the number of times the application set may execute until its end-of-life is maximized, we propose BALDER. It is a learning framework capable of automatically choosing optimal configuration executions (PPI and number of threads) according to the parallel application at hand, aiming to maximize the tradeoff between aging and performance. When executing ten well-known applications on two multicore embedded architectures, we show that BALDER can find a nearly optimal configuration for all our experiments.

AB This letter presents trivial bypassing to detect and skip execution of trivial instructions in general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). During the execution of a program, a significant number of instructions are trivial; that is, the instructions do not need functional units for execution. The outcome of such instructions can be determined based on source operands. Execution of these instructions unnecessarily wastes hardware resources and reduces energy efficiency of GPGPUs. We propose a microarchitectural technique that detects and bypasses trivial instructions dynamically and during the runtime. By bypassing trivial instructions, the energy of functional units is reduced. In addition to functional units, the other component that benefits from trivial bypassing is the register file. We exploit register renaming to remap destination field of trivial instructions. Using register renaming, logical registers with the same values share the same physical registers. This reduces the number of accesses to physical registers and enhances the energy efficiency of GPGPUs. Evaluations using a wide range of applications reveal that trivial bypassing reduces the energy of GPGPUs by 8% with negligible impact on performance.

   universal-filtered multicarrier (UFMC)
AB Universal-filtered multicarrier (UFMC) is one of the potential candidates for 5G multicarrier waveforms due to its several attractive features such as suppressed out-of-band radiation to the nearby sub-band. However, the hardware realization of UFMC systems is limited by a large number of arithmetic units for inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and pulse shaping filters. In this letter, we propose an architecture that presents a refreshing approach toward designing a low-complexity architecture for the baseband UFMC transmitter with Dolph-Chebyshev filter. Compared to the read-only-memory (ROM)-based state-of-the-art, the proposed architecture requires less number of ROM locations and has the flexibility to externally select the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT)-size, number of sub-bands, and number of subcarriers in a sub-band. Moreover, we implement the proposed architecture on a commercially available Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device for testing and analyzing the baseband UFMC signal. Finally, the XILINX post-route results are found comparable with MATLAB simulations.

AB Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-based embedded systems are easy to implement, reconfigure, test, and validate. Configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and memory blocks are the building blocks of FPGA. The rising issues in CMOS fabrication at smaller nanometer levels has increased the need for beyond-CMOS technologies to build complex circuits at extremely smaller nanometer levels. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a nascent beyond-CMOS nanotechnology technique to design low-power and high-performance digital circuits. In this letter, a layout strategy is proposed to design QCA circuits. Using the proposed strategy, novel and cost-efficient designs of CLBs and memory blocks are proposed. The proposed blocks can be used to develop FPGA architecture and FPGA-based embedded systems in QCA. The proposed circuits are cost effective and perform better than many state-of-the-art designs. Simulation and verification are done in QCADesigner using coherence vector simulation engine.

AB In the last decade, deep learning techniques reached human-level performance in several specific tasks as image recognition, object detection, and adaptive control. For this reason, deep learning is being seriously considered by the industry to address difficult perceptual and control problems in several safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving, robotics, and space missions). However, at the moment, deep learning software poses a number of issues related to safety, security, and predictability, which prevent its usage in safety-critical systems. This letter proposes a visionary software architecture that allows embracing deep learning while guaranteeing safety, security, and predictability by design. To achieve this goal, the architecture integrates multiple and diverse technologies, as hypervisors, run time monitoring, redundancy with diversity, predictive fault detection, fault recovery, and predictable resource management. Open challenges that stems from the proposed architecture are finally discussed.

AB Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision are trained on a large number of images from numerous categories to form rich discriminative feature extractors. Inference using such models on resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms poses a challenge and an opportunity. Having limited computation, storage, and energy budgets, most IoT platforms are not capable of hosting such compute intensive models. However, typical IoT applications demand detection of a relatively small number of categories, albeit the specific categories of interest may change at runtime as the context evolves dynamically. In this letter, we take advantage of the opportunity to address the challenge. Specifically, we develop a novel transformation to the architecture of a given CNN, so that the majority of the inference workload is allocated to class-specific disjoint branches, which can be dynamically executed or skipped, based on the context, to fulfill the application requirements. Experiments demonstrate that our approach preserves the classification accuracy for the classes of interest, while proportionally decreasing the model complexity and inference workload.

AB The use of hardware to perform part of central processing unit (CPU) processing functions is a consolidated practice that produces good results in terms of power and performance when applied in embedded systems. This letter describes the changes in the processor architecture to embed the functions of a microkernel to boost the performance of task-based systems. Part of the CPU overhead is caused by the microkernel to run the scheduler algorithm and context switching. Therefore, the microkernel's functions, supported by a single additional internal register bank, were implemented by hardware to work in parallel with the CPU to reduce the task dispatch time. The experimental results show that by using this approach, the performance is virtually independent of the time slice, whereas the conventional approach (software implementation) is degraded by 79% as the time slice decreases.

DE Branch prediction; digital signal processors (DSPs)
AB This letter presents a novel approach for designing a dynamic branch predictor. The proposed design, called decoupled-predictor literally decouples the prediction making from the prediction update stages of the scheme. This separation is intended to tailor each part for its particular task and to reduce unnecessary references to these parts. In this letter, we show that embedded digital signal processors (DSPs) can benefit from dynamic branch prediction while staying within strict memory limitations. This letter presents a detailed description of the predictor architecture and evaluates its performance through a set of trace driven simulations of embedded DSP applications. Finally, we address the design cost efficiency by offering memory saving optimizations.

AB The existing 2-D median filters in the literature are computationally intensive. It is proposed to optimally reduce the amount of data handled at the architecture level realization of the basic median filtering operation on images. The proposed architecture reads 4 pixels at a time in the input image, 4 pixels forming a word on a 32-bit hardware processing system; the subsequent processing is carried out by parallel and pipelined median filter architecture. Two read operations process eight input pixels which results in the generation of four output pixels with an initial latency. The proposed architecture offers reduced number of read operations and increased speed.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB In reinforcement learning (RL) an agent interacts with the environment based on sequential decisions. This agent receives a reward from the environment according to decisions and tries to maximize the reward. RL is used in several domains, such as production, autonomous driving, business management, education, games, healthcare, natural language processing, robotics, and among others. RL methodologies require processing large volumes of data and computational power. To speed up these applications, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) are widely employed in the literature. This letter proposes an accelerator for theMarkov decision process (MDP) implemented in the AI-Toolbox public library using high-level synthesis tools, using the tiger-antelope problem as use case. Our approach shows an acceleration greater than 7x compared to the original version.

ID ON-CHIP
AB The network on chip (NoC) used in the AI chip is required to be able to deliver data to multiple destination endpoints simultaneously. The existing solutions, such as hierarchial mesh (HMESH) and FATTREE all modify the connection between routers to achieve multicasting. Although this method can achieve delivering data to multiple destination endpoints at the same time, it significantly increases the number of routers used and, therefore, brings a huge additional area and power consumption overhead. In order to solve this problem, this work designed a customized multicast-enabled tree-based NoC, named mTREE, by modifying the microarchitecture of the router, including the routing calculation unit, credit counter, and switch allocator. When implemented on Arria10 FPGA, mTREE only brings a 1% increase in resource utilization compared with the traditional tree-topology NoC. Compared with two other multicast-enabled NoCs: 1) FATTREE and 2) HMESH, mTREE can reach a 3.19 x-3.50 x and 1.67 x-3.02 x reduction in resource utilization, respectively, and a 4.81 x -8.01 x and 2.85 x -3.03 x reduction in energy consumption, respectively.

ID TURN MODEL
AB Wraparound channels in Torus network-on-chip (NoC) help in reducing overall hop counts traversed by traffic. However, the cyclic paths created by the wraparound channel make Torus NoC deadlock prone. The Turn model and channel dependency graph (CDG) are two classical approaches used for detecting and avoiding deadlock in NoC. In this work, we propose an Arc model for avoiding deadlock in Torus NoC. The Arc model is an extension to the Turn model and is useful for deadlock avoidance in Torus. Directional dependency graph (DDG) is also presented in this work by combining both the Turn model and CDG for detecting deadlock in Torus NoC. DDG is a simpler approach for identifying deadlock scenarios, formulating deadlock avoidance, and showing deadlock freedom while using the Arc model along with a set of Turns.

AB The design of the power management logic (PML) of complex low-power system-on-chip (SoC) designs is rooted in the expected workload patterns in the target architecture. The increasing functionality of SoCs is complimented by increasingly diverse usage patterns among its users, leading to a situation where the same device is power efficient for some user and power inefficient for others. This letter positions the potential benefits of personalizing the PML in SoCs leveraging that the global power management strategy resides in firmware.

DT Article
DE C++; coroutines; embedded software; Internet of Things (IoT);

AB Coroutines will be added to C++ as part of the C++20 standard. Coroutines provide native language support for asynchronous operations. This letter evaluates the C++ coroutine specification from the perspective of embedded systems developers. We find that the proposed language features are generally beneficial, but that memory management of the coroutine state needs to be improved. Our experiments on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller evaluate the time and memory costs of coroutines in comparison with alternatives, and we show that context switching with coroutines is significantly faster than with thread-based real-time operating systems. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of these language features on prototypical Internet of Things sensor software. We find that the proposed language enhancements potentially bring significant benefits to programming in C++ for embedded computers, but that the implementation imposes constraints that may prevent its widespread acceptance among the embedded development community.

This development strains hardware and software design, verification, and system validation efforts. This letter introduces a virtual platform (VP) centered design flow that not only enables early software development but also considers a solution for the challenges on hardware and system level. As a core element, a hybrid prototyping framework targeting networks-on-chip (NoC) links for interfacing a VP and a field-programmable gate array provides scalability and accuracy for hardware verification and system validation.

AB For many Ethernet-based real-time systems, such as those from automotive, avionics, and industry automation domains, fault tolerance is emerged as an essential requirement for enabling fail-safe or fail-operational behavior. Consequently, the IEEE 802.1CB-2017 standard was published. It is currently the only available time-sensitive networking group standard offering protection against transmission errors. It tackles these faults by preventively replicating the frames and transmitting redundant copies via different paths to the destination. However, in contrast to its obvious advantages, the standard contains some pitfalls: most notably, it lacks protection mechanisms against inadequate configurations, which can not only invalidate the intended increase in reliability but even actively jeopardize the safety of the network. Due to the lack of alternative mechanisms, it is crucial to fully understand the fundamental properties of the standard and its implications on the safety aspects of the network traffic. In this letter, we identify critical aspects and limitations of the standard. We demonstrate the risks of inadequate configurations, discuss their ramifications. Finally, we provide an intuition and initial steps toward deriving the formal worst-case timing analysis of the standard, which is a key requirement for its safe and efficient implementation in the aforementioned real-time domains.

TI Enlarging I/O Size for Faster Loading of Mobile Applications
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Application loading performance; flash storage; mobile application;
   user-perceived performance
AB As the size of mobile applications grows rapidly, the importance of application loading performance is increasingly emphasized in mobile devices. However, current operating systems rely on demand paging to load the working set of applications into memory, which typically generates small size input/outputs (I/Os) that are not handled well by mobile flash storage devices. We propose an aggressive merging scheme, which consists of an explicit application loading method and a series of optimization techniques: I/O reordering, I/O merging, and I/O padding. The key idea behind our scheme is to enlarge I/O size for application loading to increase the effective storage throughput. Experiments show that our scheme effectively increases the average I/O size by 5.6x, leading to 30% reduction of working set loading time.

AB Considering the energy-cap problem in battery-powered devices, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, and power gating represent the de-facto state-of-the-art actuators. However, the limited margin available to reduce the operating voltage, the impossibility to massively integrate such actuators on-chip together with their actuation latency force a revision of such design methodologies. We present an all-digital architecture and a design methodology that can effectively manage the energy-cap problem for CPUs and accelerators. Two quality metrics are put forward to capture the performance loss and the energy budget violations. We employed a vector processor supporting four hardware threads as representative usecase. Results show an average performance loss and energy cap violations limited to 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Compared with solutions employing the dynamic frequency scaling actuator, our all-digital architecture improves the energy-cap violations by $3\times $ while maintaining a similar performance loss.

AB Domain-specific acceleration is now a must for all the computing spectrum, going from high performance computing to embedded systems. Unfortunately, system specialization is by nature a nightmare from the design productivity perspective. Nevertheless, in contexts where kernels to be accelerated are intrinsically streaming oriented, the combination of dataflow (DF) models of computation with coarse-grained reconfiguration (CGR) architectures can be particularly handful. In this letter we introduce a novel methodology to assemble and characterize virtually reconfigurable accelerators based on DF and functional programming principles, capable of addressing design productivity issues for CGR accelerators. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is accurate IP-level latency predictability improving design space exploration when compared with state-of-the-art high-level synthesis.

AB Designing complex embedded systems requires simultaneous optimization of multiple system performance metrics that can be addressed by applying Pareto-based multi-objective optimization techniques. At the end of this type of optimization process, designers always face Pareto fronts (PFs) including a large number of near-optimal solutions from which selecting the most proper system implementation is potentially infeasible. In this letter, for the first time, we present HypAp, a hypervolume-based automated approach to systematically help designers efficiently choose their preferred solutions after the optimization process. HypAp is a two-stage approach relying on clustering Pareto optimal solutions and then finding a subset of solutions that maximizes the hypervolume by using a genetic algorithm. The performance of HypAp is evaluated through applying HypAp to the PF by the case study of mapping applications on network-on-chip-based heterogeneous MPSoC.

AB Memory management on many-core architectures is a major challenge for improving the overall system performance. Memory resources are distributed over nodes for faster local accesses. Dynamic workloads heavily depend on memory requests and inefficient memory management leads to severe bottlenecks and performance degradation. In this paper, we focus on optimizing dynamic memory allocation on such platforms and present a scalable, microcode-accelerated distributed dynamic memory manager. The proposed manager exploits the presence of a hardware accelerator while offering a C application programming interface to application developers. Experimental results show performance gains on average 10% compared to allocators written purely in C and sufficient scalability as platform size increases.

AB Desk workers spend long periods sitting with poor posture. This leads to back pain and musculoskeletal disorders. Current solutions to track posture use sensors or cameras that may make sitting uncomfortable and violate privacy. This letter presents a system that detects the leg position when sitting at a desk via 2-D light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and a support vector machine running on a Raspberry Pi 4. The system recognizes six common positions: legs slightly open with knees bent, legs crossed, one leg on the other leg's knee, legs extended forward, backward, and legs parallel with an angle of similar to 90. between upper and lower legs. The results of an experiment involving 30 workers showed an accuracy of 99.2%.

AB In this letter, we present the design and implementation results of two hardware accelerators for the supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE) suite. These designs aim at enabling quantum-safe cryptography solutions for constrained platforms by offloading the cost of bulk arithmetic from the main processor. One of the proposed architectures has area reduction as the main implementation goal; the second design improves the former on the energy footprint. This software-hardware co-design addresses the challenges of performing bulk arithmetic in software and reducing the control complexity in hardware, thus minimizing the communication overheads found on simple arithmetic accelerators. Compared to other designs in the literature, the proposed architectures do not rely on in-fabric memory and processing units, a key point for porting such solutions to any implementation technology such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

TI Enabling 3-D Object Detection With a Low-Resolution LiDAR
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE 3-D vehicle detection; camera; low-resolution light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR)
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been widely used in autonomous vehicles for perception and localization. However, the cost of a high-resolution LiDAR is still prohibitively expensive, while its low-resolution counterpart is much more affordable. Therefore, using low-resolution LiDAR for autonomous driving is an economically viable solution, but the point cloud sparsity makes it extremely challenging. In this letter, we propose a two-stage neural network framework that enables 3-D object detection using a low-resolution LiDAR. Taking input from a low-resolution LiDAR point cloud and a monocular camera image, a depth completion network is employed to produce dense point cloud that is subsequently processed by a voxel-based network for 3-D object detection. Evaluated with KITTI dataset for 3-D object detection in bird-eye view (BEV), the experimental result shows that the proposed approach performs significantly better than directly applying the 16-line LiDAR point cloud for object detection. For both easy and moderate cases, our 3-D vehicle detection results are close to those using 64-line high-resolution LiDARs.

DT Article
DE Embedded system; lightweight model; robotic grasping; template matching
AB This letter proposes a lightweight DNN model for robotic grasping applications with just 1.5 million architecture parameters. In the proposed model, the location of the target object is estimated using a pairwise template matching method, while the orientation of the object is predicted using depth images and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally on an NVIDIA Jetson NX developer kit. The experimental results show that the grasping system achieves an accuracy of 96.3% and a running time of 125 ms when on 700 images. Moreover, when applied to practical grasping tasks on 20 unseen objects selected from the Cornell grasping dataset, the system achieves an accuracy of 92.5%, which is comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature.

DE Artificial intelligence (AI); embedded edge devices; oral cavity cancer

AB Diagnosing oral cavity cancer (OCC) in its initial stages is an effective way to reduce patient mortality. However, current prescreening solutions are manual and the resultant clinical treatment is not cost effective for the average individual, primarily in developing nations. In this letter, we present an automated and inexpensive prescreening solution utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) deployed on embedded edge devices to detect benign and premalignant superficial oral tongue lesions. The proposed machine vision solution utilizes a clinically annotated photographic dataset of nine types of superficial oral tongue lesions to retrain a MobileNetV2 neural network using transfer learning. In this approach, we also utilized TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers to quantize a 32-bit floating point (float32) precision model into an 8-bit integer (int8) model for deployment on power and resource-constrained OpenMV Cam H7 Plus embedded edge device. The quantized int8 model was able to detect the nine tongue lesions with an accuracy of 98.69% on the test set. More than 60% reduction in on-device RAM and flash memory usage were measured for the int8 model when compared to the equivalently performing float32 model for relatively the same inference speed (similar to 1.1 ms) on the target edge device.

AB Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been the subject of extensive study for the past two decades. DVFS has been shown to dramatically reduce power consumption and thermal stress and is now routinely used in both embedded and general-purpose systems. However, DVFS research has largely focused on independently controlling voltage and frequency for individual cores. Less well studied is the case of global DVFS (GDVS), where multiple cores share the same voltage and clock. A very simple GDVS heuristic is presented in this letter; it is lightweight and effectively exploits task profiling information to appropriately sequence task executions. Simulation studies show its effectiveness.

TI Infeasibility Test for Fixed-Priority Scheduling on Multiprocessor

DE Fixed-priority scheduling (FPS); infeasibility test; multiprocessor
   platforms; real-time embedded systems
AB Fixed-priority scheduling (FPS), due to its simplicity to implement, has been one of the most popular scheduling algorithms for real-time embedded systems equipped with multi-processor platforms. While there have been many studies that find sufficient conditions for a given task set to be feasible (schedulable) by FPS with a proper priority assignment, the other direction (i.e., finding infeasible task sets) has not been studied. In this letter, we address a necessary feasibility condition that judges a given task set to be infeasible under FPS with every priority assignment on multiprocessor platforms. To this end, we derive useful properties for the condition and develop the first infeasibility test for FPS on multiprocessor platforms. Via simulations, we show that the proposed infeasibility test discovers a number of FPS-infeasible task sets which are not proven FPS-infeasible by any existing studies.

AB The data size and data feature under the current mainstream compilation schemes can be diversified, formal methods are thus mandatory. However, in a micro base station, as an embedded system, the typical feature or opportunity of baseband algorithms is its predictable small code and data sizes. The research is thus needed and there is so far no dedicated research on the related register allocation algorithms. In this letter, we focus on compilation research for baseband kernel subroutines of 5G micro base stations. We proposed a parallel data access compilation scheme for applications with fixed and known data sizes, while operation data can be mostly stored and allocated in the register file (RF). The goal of the compilation scheme is to optimize algorithms based on 4x4 or smaller matrices, to reach the maximum RF utility, and eliminate the extra register data swapping. At the same time, we hide the data access time when allocating data into the RF, and minimize the data access cost by using the VLIW machine, so that the overall running time is minimum. Based on a small register group (48x32b) and the proposed compilation method, this letter implemented frequently used baseband subroutines (kernels) of 4x4 matrix with complex variables of 16b+16b and reached minimized run time. Results show that the extra addressing and data accessing cost is minimized for algorithms with small data sizes.

AB We introduce a simple figure-of-merit (foM) to schedule task executions in frame-based CPS workloads. The objective is to more effectively harvest the slack released by early task completions. The foM is derived based on the task execution time probability density functions (obtained by profiling). A nominal voltage/frequency is assigned to each task based on its activity factor; the aim is to keep power consumption reasonably steady. The simulation results show that this approach lengthens battery lifetime and reduces thermally induced processor aging.

AB Users of embedded and cyber-physical systems expect dependable operation for an increasingly diverse set of applications and environments. Reactive self-diagnosis techniques either use unnecessarily conservative guardbands, or do not prevent catastrophic failures. In this letter, we utilize machine-learning techniques to design a prediction engine in order to predict failures on-device in the embedded systems. We evaluate our prediction engine's effectiveness for predicting temperature behavior on a mobile system-on-chip and propose a realizable hardware implementation for the use-case.

AB In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used. However, their ever-increasing amount of parameters makes it challenging to train them with the GPUs, which is time and energy expensive. This has prompted researchers to turn their attention to training on more energy-efficient hardware. batch normalization (BN) layer has been widely used in various state-of-the-art CNNs for it is an indispensable layer in the acceleration of CNN training. As the amount of computation of the convolutional layer declines, its importance continues to increase. However, the traditional CNN training accelerators do not pay attention to the efficient hardware implementation of the BN layer. In this letter, we design an efficient CNN training architecture by using the systolic array. The processing element of the systolic array can support the BN functions both in the training process and the inference process. The BN function implemented is an improved, hardware-friendly BN algorithm, range batch normalization (RBN). The experimental results show that the implementation of RBN saves 10% hardware resources, reduces the power by 10.1%, and the delay by 4.6% on average. We implement the accelerator on the field programmable gate array VU440, and the power consumption of the its core computing engine is 8.9 W.

TI Improved Schedulability Test for Non-Preemptive Fixed-Priority
   Scheduling on Multiprocessors

DE Non-preemptive fixed-priority scheduling (NP-FP); real-time embedded
   systems; real-time tasks; schedulability analysis
AB Non-preemptive scheduling is essential to tasks that inherently disallow any preemption and useful for tasks that exhibit extremely large preemption/migration overhead; however, studies of non-preemptive scheduling have not matured for real-time tasks subject to timing constraints. In this letter, we propose an improved schedulability test for non-preemptive fixed-priority scheduling (NP-FP), which offers timing guarantees for a set of real-time tasks executed on a multiprocessor platform. To this end, we first carefully investigate the NP-FP properties, and present an observation why the existing technique is pessimistic in calculating interference from higher-priority tasks. We then develop a new technique that tightly upper bounds the amount of the interference, and show how to incorporate the technique into the existing schedulability test. Via simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed test improves schedulability performance of NP-FP up to 18%, compared with the state-of-the-art existing tests.

AB Fault-injection attacks against cryptographic devices have been studied in great detail. As a countermeasure to such attacks, the flush code eraser (FCE) has been proposed. The FCE realizes a new attack reaction in which sensitive data in a cryptographic device are quickly invalidated by redistributing the electrons in the circuits. In this letter, we discuss the abilities of the FCE by evaluating the data invalidation period with experiments using a test chip. As a result, the invalidation period is estimated to be approximately 80 ps, which enhances the security of the cryptographic device and also prevents the possibility of the future attacks.

DT Article
DE Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); overlay; security
AB Virtualization has well-known security advantages for operating systems and software, but current techniques do not address increasingly important hardware-security concerns. For widely deployed systems (e.g., Internet of Things) and safety-critical systems (e.g., defense and automobiles), protecting against device tampering is critical, but is often unavoidable due to the relative ease of side-channel attacks. In this letter, we present a novel usage of virtualization that limits damage from bit-stream tampering to a single instance of a deployed system by employing unique virtual architectures (i.e., overlays) on field-programmable gate arrays.

TI Battery Current's Fluctuations Removal in Hybrid Energy Storage System

AB In a hybrid energy storage system, batteries play an important role to store and release energy when it is required. Because batteries are very expensive, increasing their life cycles has a paramount importance in cost justification of the energy storage systems. However, current fluctuations reduce normal life cycles of batteries. As a remedy, supercapacitors are adopted to reduce the current fluctuations to smooth battery's current. Recently, researchers have attempted to minimize the batteries' current fluctuations by controlling the supercapacitor's current and/or voltage, with a limited reported success. This letter proposes an enhanced approach to reduce batteries' current fluctuations and to minimize energy lost for residential applications, by controlling the supercapacitor's voltage using two optimization stages: 1) predictive reference voltage determination and 2) online voltage adjustment. The proposed method has been evaluated using simulated and real data, and results validate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art.

The proposed system uses the ZigBee-based wireless devices which allow more efficient lamps management. The designed system uses sensors to control and guarantee the optimal system parameters. To realize effectiveness of the proposed system, the prototype has been installed inside the University, where the experimental results proved that the proposed system saves around 70.8% energy for the outdoor street environment because of using sensors, LED lamps, and ZigBee based communication network.

AB In this article, we introduce Flip-On-Chip, the first end-to-end tool that thoroughly examines the vulnerability of embedded DRAM against rowhammer bit flips. Our tool, Flip-On-Chip, utilizes DRAM address mapping information to efficiently and deterministically perform a double-sided RowHammer test. We evaluated Flip-On-Chip on two DRAM modules: 1) LPDDR2 and 2) LPDDR4. It is found that our proposed tool increases the number of bit flips by 7.34 % on LPDDR2 and by 99.97 % on LPDDR4, as compared to state-of-the-art approaches provided in the literature. Additionally, Flip-On-Chip takes into account a number of system-level parameters to evaluate their influence on triggering Rowhammer bit flips.

   side-channel attacks (SCA)
AB Differential deep learning analysis (DDLA) is the first deep-learning-based nonprofiled side-channel attack (SCA) on embedded systems. However, DDLA requires many training processes to distinguish the correct key. In this letter, we introduce a nonprofiled SCA technique using multi-output classification to mitigate the aforementioned issue. Specifically, a multi-output multilayer perceptron and a multi-output convolutional neural network are introduced against various SCA protected schemes, such as masking, noise generation, and trace de-synchronization countermeasures. The experimental results on different power side channel datasets have clarified that our model performs the attack up to 9-30 times faster than DDLA in the case of masking and de-synchronization countermeasures, respectively. In addition, regarding combined masking and noise generation countermeasure, our proposed model achieves a higher success rate of at least 20% in the cases of the standard deviation equal to 1.0 and 1.5.

TI Optimizing Learned Bloom Filters: How Much Should Be Learned?

AB The learned Bloom filter (LBF) combines a machine learning model (learner) with a traditional Bloom filter to improve the false positive rate (FPR) that can be achieved for a given memory budget. The LBF has recently been generalized by making use of the full spectrum of the learner's prediction score. However, in all those designs, the machine learning model is fixed. In this letter, for the first time, the design of LBFs is proposed and evaluated by considering the machine learning model as one of the variables in the process. In detail, for a given memory budget, several LBFs are constructed using different machine learning models and the one with the lowest FPR is selected. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve much better performance than existing LBF designs providing reductions of the FPR of up to 90% in some settings.

AB As deep learning (DL) inference applications are increasing, an embedded device tends to equip neural processing units (NPUs) in addition to a CPU and a GPU. For fast and efficient development of DL applications, TensorRT is provided as the software development kit for the NVIDIA hardware platform, including optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high throughput for DL inference. Like most DL frameworks, TensorRT assumes that the inference is executed on a single processing element, GPU, or NPU, not both. In this letter, we propose a parallelization methodology to maximize the throughput of a single DL application using both GPU and NPU by exploiting various types of parallelism on TensorRT. With six real-life benchmarks, we could achieve 81%-391% throughput improvement over the baseline inference using GPU only.

AB Leading zero count (LZC) is a fundamental building block in floating-point arithmetic and data sketches. These applications are increasingly being implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), however, existing architectures for LZC target application-specific integrated circuits and to the best of our knowledge specific LZC implementations tailored to FPGA structures have not been presented. In this letter, the implementation of LZC on Xilinx FPGA is considered and it is shown that by carefully adapting the LZC design to the FPGA structure, more efficient implementations can be obtained. In more detail, LZC designs for different bit widths are presented and evaluated. The results show that significant reductions in the FPGA resources needed are obtained that reach 33% lookup tables (LUTs) saving for 32-bit vectors and 20% LUTs saving for 64-bit vectors.

ID SUITE
AB High-level synthesis (HLS) frameworks allow to easily specify a large number of variants of the same hardware design by only acting on optimization directives. Nonetheless, the hardware synthesis of implementations for all possible combinations of directive values is impractical even for simple designs. Addressing this shortcoming, many HLS design space exploration (DSE) strategies have been proposed to devise directive settings leading to high-quality implementations while limiting the number of synthesis runs. All these works require considerable efforts to validate the proposed strategies and/or to build the knowledge base employed to tune abstract models, as both tasks mandate the syntheses of large collections of implementations. Currently, such data gathering is performed ad hoc: 1) leading to a lack of standardization, hampering comparisons between DSE alternatives; and 2) posing a very high burden to researchers willing to develop novel DSE strategies. Against this backdrop, we here introduce DB4HLS, a database of exhaustive HLS explorations comprising more than 100 000 design points collected over four years equivalent of synthesis time. The open structure of DB4HLS allows the incremental integration of new DSEs, which can be easily defined with a dedicated domain-specific language. We think that of our database, available at https://www.db4hls.inf.usi.ch/,https://www.db4hls.inf.usi.ch/, will be a valuable tool for the research community investigating automated strategies for the optimization of HLS-based hardware designs.

AB This letter presented a novel routing method to improve the energy efficiency among different clusters during intercluster routing decision making. To this end, the theory of energy welfare was applied to promote energy equality. Besides, the compressive sensing (CS) theory was utilized in intracluster data acquisition to further reduce data redundancy. Subsequently, an energy-efficient routing based on CS from the perspective of social welfare was proposed. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted and the numerical results verified its effectiveness on improving the energy efficiency and prolonging the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks.

ID RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR
AB We introduce a method for nonuniform random number generation based on sampling a physical process in a controlled environment. We demonstrate one proof-of-concept implementation of the method, that doubles the speed of Monte Carlo integration of a univariate Gaussian. We show that we must measure and compensate for the supply voltage and temperature of the physical process to prevent the mean and standard deviation from drifting. The method we present and our detailed empirical hardware measurements demonstrate the feasibility of programmable nonuniform random variate generation from low-power sensors and the effect of ADC quantization on the statistical qualities of the approach.

AB Modern field-programmable gate arrays offer dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) capabilities, a characteristic that opens new scheduling opportunities for real-time applications running on heterogeneous platforms. To evaluate when it is really useful to exploit a DPR, in this letter, we present the characterization of its reconfiguration cost in terms of time and a definition of the "DPR Profitability" concept targeting real-time systems. To obtain such results, the components involved in a DPR process have been identified and an innovative approach to calculate the DPR time and its worst-case bound is provided. We validate our approach on a real DPR-compliant platform, showing that our proposal is general enough to be applied to modern DPR-compliant platforms.

AB Heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) architectures allow designers to achieve energy efficiency and high performance, especially when tailored for the target applications. This specialization requires to select the MPSoC components and define their interconnections (on the architecture side), and also to determine the mapping and scheduling of tasks and communications (on the application side). This problem is exacerbated by the growing privacy and security concerns when these architectures elaborate sensitive data. We propose a co-design solution based on ant colony optimization that also protects the exchange of private data among components. Our solution generates architectures with secure communications with systematically better performance than architectures with predefined security solutions.

The thermal phase-guided task allocation allows the scheduler to allocate tasks that run at elevated temperature to low-power cores while others running at normal temperature to high performing cores. The proposed phase-based thermal aware technique shows 15.4 degrees C reduction in average temperature and 30.5 degrees C in peak temperature when experimented with PARSEC benchmark applications targeted on the ODROID XU4 embedded platform.

   identification (SI)
AB This letter discusses a novel low-power digital CMOS architecture for speaker identification (SI) by combining $k$ -means clustering with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) scoring. We show that $k$ -means clustering at the front-end reduces the dimensionality of speech features to minimize downstream processing without affecting SI accuracy. Implementation of cluster generator is discussed with novel distance computing and online centroid update datapaths to minimize overhead of the clustering layer (CL). The integrated design achieves $6\times $ lower energy than the conventional for SI among ten speakers.

AB The security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) often influence each other. Ensuring that this does not have negative implications might require a large and rigorous effort during the development of CPS. However, early in the life-cycle, quick feedback can be valuable helping security and safety engineers to understand how seemingly trivial design choices in their domain may have unacceptable implications in the other. We propose the cyber risk assessment framework (CRAF) for this purpose. The CRAF is based on openly available and widely used taxonomies from the safety and security domains, and a unique mapping of where loss of data security may impact aspects of data with safety implications. This letter represents the first time these different elements have been brought together into a single framework with an associated process. Through examples from within our organizations we show how this framework can be put to good use.

AB Network on chip (NoC) architectures enable efficient and scalable interconnection between hardware accelerators on the same chip. Most of the traditional NoC architectures are highly resource intensive and suffer from low clock performance when implemented on field programmable gate array platforms. They fail to provide standard interface to accelerators and fall short on detailing the external interface. Availability of open source NoC infrastructures saves development time also faster adoption of this technique. This letter discusses the implementation of OpenNoC, an open source lite-weight deflection torus-based NoC with PCIe-based communication controller.

DE Hardware security; high-level synthesis (HLS)
AB High-level synthesis (HLS) tools have made significant progress in the past few years, improving the design productivity for hardware accelerators and becoming mainstream in industry to create specialized system-on-chip architectures. Increasing the level of security of these heterogeneous architectures is becoming critical. However, state-of-the-art security countermeasures are still applied only to the code executing on the processor cores or manually implemented into the generated components, leading to suboptimal and sometimes even insecure designs. This letter discusses extensions to HLS tools for creating secure heterogeneous architectures.

AB Approximate computing is the idea that systems can gain performance and energy efficiency if they expend less effort on producing a "perfect" answer. Approximate computing techniques propose various ways of exposing and exploiting accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. We present a taxonomy that classifies approximate computing techniques according to salient features: visibility, determinism, and coarseness. These axes allow us to address questions about the correctability, reproducibility, and control over accuracy- efficiency tradeoffs of different techniques. We use this taxonomy to inform research challenges in approximate architectures, compilers, and applications.

DT Article
DE Energy; latency; power; radix-16 carry-save adder; radix-16 sequential
   multiplier
AB We propose a new sequential multiplier design that generates the radix-16 partial products (e.g., P) as two high (H) and low (L) components, such that P = 4H + L, H, L is an element of {0, 1, 2, 3} x X, where X denotes the multiplicand. The required hard 3X multiple is generated in a preliminary cycle to the advantage of reducing the cycle time of the main iteration. Two radix-16 carry-save adders are used to generate the radix-16 accumulated partial product. The synthesis results show improved latency, power dissipation, and energy consumption over the previous relevant designs at the cost of additional silicon area, while, however, the energy-area product is also lowered.

TI DynaFuse: Dynamic Fusion for Resource Efficient Multimodal Machine
   Learning Inference
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Energy efficiency; multimodal machine learning (MMML); run-time systems
AB Multimodal machine learning (MMML) applications combine results from different modalities in the inference phase to improve prediction accuracy. Existing MMML fusion strategies use static modality weight assignment, based on the intrinsic value of sensor modalities determined during the training phase. However, input data perturbations in practical scenarios affect the intrinsic value of modalities in the inference phase, lowering prediction accuracy, and draining computational and energy resources. In this letter, we present dynamic fusion (DynaFuse), a framework for dynamic and adaptive fusion of MMML inference to set modality weights, considering run-time parameters of input data quality and sensor energy budgets. We determine the insightfulness of modalities by combining the design-time intrinsic value with the run-time extrinsic value of different modalities to assign updated modality weights, catering to both accuracy requirements and energy conservation demands. The DynaFuse approach achieves up to 22% gain in prediction accuracy and an average energy savings of 34% on exemplary MMML applications of human activity recognition and stress monitoring in comparison with state-of-the-art static fusion approaches.

AB Nonvolatile memories are widely considered as a potential replacement of DRAM in main memory due to their high density and low-leakage power consumption. The data in these memories are stored in encrypted form to protect them from data stealing. However, the encryption techniques, on account of their diffusion property impose high randomization in the generated encrypted data. It leads to enormous bit-flips in the memory cells, leading to their early wear out. In this letter, we propose a technique called CADEN that combines our compression technique COMF with an adaptive encoding scheme. The compressed data generated by COMF is encoded in finer granularity using an adaptive encoding approach at low storage overhead. Experimental evaluation shows that CADEN reduces bit-flips and improves lifetime in PCM main memory compared to baseline and existing techniques. In particular, CADEN shows 52% and 57% reduction in bit-flips and energy consumption and 2.31x improvement in lifetime over baseline.

AB Spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) is an emerging nonvolatile memory technology that has been received significant attention due to its higher density and lower leakage current over SRAM. One compelling use case is to employ STT-MRAM as a graphics processing unit (GPU) register file (RF) to reduce its massive energy consumption. One critical challenge is that STT-MRAM has longer access latency and higher dynamic power consumption than SRAM, which motivates the hierarchical RF that places a small SRAM-based register cache (RC) between functional units and STT-MRAM RF. The RC acts as the write buffer, so all the writes on the RF are first performed on the RC. In the presence of a conflict miss, the RC writes back the corresponding cache line into the RF. In this work, we observe that a large amount of such write-back operations are unnecessary because they include register values that are never used again. Leveraging this observation, we propose a compiler-assisted hierarchical RF in GPUs (CASH-RF) that optimizes STT-MRAM accesses by removing dead register values. In CASH-RF, unnecessary write-back operations are detected by the compiler via the last consumer analysis. At runtime, the corresponding RC lines are discarded after the last references without being updated to the RF. Compared to the baseline GPUs, CASH-RF removes 59.5% of write-back operations, which leads to 54.7% lower RF energy consumption with only 2.6% of performance degradation.

DE Cyber-physical systems; fault tolerance; system-level design
AB Cyber-physical systems are more and more employed to implement smart environments also in safety-critical scenarios. We here propose a novel system-level design approach capable of considering two relevant aspects of such systems: 1) elaborations together with sensing and actuation need to be placed in the zones where cyber-physical interactions take place and 2) fault-tolerance mechanisms have to be incorporated to tolerate device failures. The proposed design approach identifies the optimal instantiation of the system architecture and deployment of the applications to minimize the monetary cost of the solution while guaranteeing resource requirements and fault tolerance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces up to 20% the solution cost w.r.t. a straightforward hardening baseline with a computationally viable execution time.

TI Guaranteeing That Multilevel Prioritized DNN Models on an Embedded GPU
   Have Inference Performance Proportional to Respective Priorities
SO IEEE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS LETTERS

DE Deep neural network (DNN) scheduling; embedded GPU; multi-DNN; priority
AB When multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) are using an embedded GPU as an accelerator, adjusting the CPU occupancy time of the process encompassing each DNN on a priority basis does not always guarantee that higher priority DNNs take priority over the GPU. To address this problem, we propose a methodology that basically uses the model from PyTorch without modification while providing additional advantages. First, the response performance of higher priority DNNs is improved by allowing DNNs to occupy the GPU in preference in proportion to the priority granted to the hosting processes. Second, it reduces the execution time of each DNN by removing the multicontext overhead that occurs under an environment with an independent process per DNN, executing DNNs in a multithreaded manner to overcome the limitation of pure Python and taking advantage of multistream for concurrent running of different DNN operations inside the GPU.

TI SMT-Based Contention-Free Task Mapping and Scheduling on SMART NoC

DE Satisfiability modulo theory (SMT); scheduling; single-cycle multihop
   asynchronous repeated traversal networks-on-chip (SMART NoC); task
   mapping
AB Networks-on-chips (NoCs) are widely used for on-chip communications in embedded multiprocessor architectures. SMART NoC achieves ultralow latency by enabling single-cycle multiple-hop transmission via bypass channels. However, the contention on the bypass channels seriously degrades the performance of SMART NoC by breaking the bypass paths. Therefore, contention-free task mapping and scheduling are essential for optimal system performance. In this letter, we propose an satisfiability modulo theories (SMTs)-based framework to find the contention-free task mapping with the minimum application schedule length. On top of the SMT's fast reasoning capability for the conditional constraints, we develop efficient search-space reduction techniques to achieve practical scalability. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 10x higher scalability compared to integer linear programming (ILP) approach with 599.5x faster average runtime for finding an optimum solution.

DE Automatic code generation; bitslicing; data-independent timing;
   repeatable-time programming
AB In typical embedded applications, the precise execution time of the program does not matter and it is sufficient to meet a real-time deadline. However, modern applications in information security have become much more time-sensitive due to the risk of timing side-channel leakage. The timing of such programs needs to be data-independent and precise. We describe a parallel synchronous software model, which executes as N parallel threads on a processor with word-length N . Each thread is a single-bit synchronous machine with precise, contention-free timing, while each of the N threads still executes as an independent machine. The resulting software supports fine-grained parallel execution. In contrast to earlier work to obtain precise and repeatable timing in software, our solution does not require modifications to the processor architecture nor specialized instruction scheduling techniques. In addition, all threads run in parallel and without contention, which eliminates the problem of thread scheduling. We use hardware (HDL) semantics to describe a thread as a single-bit synchronous machine. Using logic synthesis and code generation, we derive a parallel synchronous implementation of this design. We illustrate the synchronous parallel programming model with practical examples from cryptography and other applications with precise timing requirements.

AB As it becomes more and more evident that approximate computing (AC) is a key enabler for next-generation computer architectures, physical realization of AC systems is gaining in relevance. This letter discusses a crucial and under-investigated area: the relationship between hardware failures and the AC paradigm. We present the opportunities of efficient test methods to improve yields of hardware blocks underlying AC components, as well as the associated conceptual and practical challenges. We distinguish between incomplete designs and underprovisioned circuits and describe shortcomings of existing test methods for both these classes of AC blocks. We also discuss the intricate interplay of approximate circuitry with failures that manifest themselves during the device's life-time.

AB Signal compression is crucial for reducing the amount of communication, and hence power consumption of wireless sensors. Lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding, are often used in healthcare applications since they do not compromise the integrity of vital signals. Techniques that adapt to changing signal patterns have been proposed. However, most of them involve significant computation overhead or are too simple to maintain high compression rates under changing signal patterns. In this letter, we propose a technique that makes use of multiple codebooks, which are generated offline based on the signal context. In the applications we study, we observe that the symbols that compose a big variety of signals follow Laplacian distributions in which the spread changes over time. This can be effectively utilized to generate a set of codebooks. Then, appropriate codebooks are selected online depending on the currently measured spread, which ensures high compression efficiency and the adaptability to changing signal patterns. Our experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our approach is computationally very efficient, and exhibits competitive compression rates. Our proposed technique outperforms a state-of-the-art compression algorithm, FAS-LEC, in terms of average data reduction by 4.3%, while consuming a similar amount of energy. Compared to the adaptive Huffman method, which achieves near-optimal compression rates, our results indicate energy savings of 19% due to the reduced computational complexity, while the compression rate is improved by 0.6%.

AB Applications with strict resource/power constraints demand the research and development of area-efficient processor designs that deliver reasonably good performance with small circuit area. While the ARM and RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISAs) are lightweight alternatives to x86, they nevertheless consume considerable circuit area and power. In this letter, we return to a fundamental question: how area efficient can a processor be while retaining the property of being "turing complete" (i.e., capable of realizing any computation)? Beginning with a recently published one-instruction-set computer, that uses a minimal amount of resources, we consider adding a second instruction to the instruction set and justify the choice of such an instruction. An experimental study illustrates the benefits of our ISA extension in terms of performance at minimal area cost.

AB This letter presents a new algorithm to construct an XOR-Free architecture of a power efficient Convolutional Encoder. Optimization of XOR operators is the main concern while implementing polynomials over GF(2), which consumes a significant amount of dynamic power. The proposed approach completely removes the XOR-processing operation of a chosen nonsystematic, feed-forward generator polynomial and reduces the logical operators, thereby the encoding cost. Hardware (HW) implementation of the proposed design uses Read-only memory (ROM) with a preprocessed addressing operations to reduce ROM size by nearly 50%. The results of the new architecture reduce the dynamic power up to 21.4% and HW cost up to 15% with lesser design complexity as compared to conventional method. The Hardware cosimulation of the architecture is first validated and then implemented with Xilinx Virtex-V FPGA.

AB This letter introduces a dedicated processor architecture, called MEGACORE, which leverages vector technology to enhance tracking performance in visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) systems. By harnessing the inherent parallelism of vector processing and incorporating a floating point unit (FPU), MEGACORE achieves significant acceleration in the tracking task of VSLAM. Through careful optimizations, we achieved notable improvements compared to the baseline design. Our optimizations resulted in a 14.9% reduction in the area parameter and a 4.4% reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by conducting application benchmarks, we determined that the average speedup ratio across all stages of the tracking process is 3.25. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MEGACORE in improving the efficiency and performance of VSLAM systems, making it a promising solution for real-world implementations in embedded systems.

AB In this work, Siwa, a micropower 32-bits RISC-V core aimed at implantable medical SoCs is presented. The core was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS-HV technology to directly drive biological stimuli circuits within the same ASIC. A complete set of power consumption measurements is presented; the core properly operated up to 30 MHz with a current consumption of 52 mu A/MHz at 1.8-V supply voltage, and <20-nA leakages at room temperature. Since the existing benchmarks are not completely adequate to compare Siwa performance to other microcontrollers used on implantable medical devices (IMDs), a simple, specific benchmark inspired in a pacemaker operation was developed. The new benchmark considers both the CPU current consumption and performance, sleep and run states, and allows to compare broadly different CPUs and operating conditions for specific IMD applications. Siwa's performance was compared using this benchmark with 8 and 16-bits MCUs.

AB The increasing interest in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is driving the study and design of different implementations for a variety of platforms, each intended to optimize performance, power consumption, or latency, according to the application's needs. While GPUs have dominated the high-performance terrain, FPGAs have proved to be a promising alternative due to their relatively high performance and reduced power consumption and costs, compared with GPUs. The main concern regarding FPGA implementations lies in the effort needed to develop the systems and difficulties reusing or combining designs by different authors, due to the highly heterogeneous architectures used in each project. This work proposes a methodology and a high-level architecture designed for CNN implementations in FPGAs, which eases the development process, allows the reusability of designs, and helps to maximize performance, minimize latency, reduce resource utilization, and avoid possible bottlenecks, while allowing high design flexibility. This proposal is validated by implementing a set of blocks that are later used to build different CNNs.

AB This letter proposes a self-healing called automatic monitoring architecture (AMA), which can help RISC-V server self-heal from hardware errors. AMA reduces redundant error classification, and only monitors hardware devices that have a relatively large proportion of errors in RISC-V server, thereby reducing the resource consumption of AMA on the basis of ensuring performance. In addition, AMA uses the Correctable-error Dynamic Threshold technology to further reduce the probability of serious uncorrectable hardware errors. Compared with an RISC-V server without a self-healing system, this architecture consumes very few hardware resources, reducing server downtime by about 80% each year. Compared with other self-healing architectures, such as Intel's machine check architecture, AMA can reduce server downtime by an additional 5% per year. Therefore, AMA is highly efficient with little resource consumption.

AB Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is a set of standards developed by the IEEE 802.1 task group to support high-bandwidth and low-latency predictable network communication. Configuration of TSN networks is a daunting task as there are several novel features in TSN and numerous possibilities can arise by considering combinations of these features. This letter investigates the impact of various unexplored frame-preemption configurations in TSN networks on the timing behaviors of various traffic classes. These configurations correspond to different combinations of settings in TSN with respect to the credit-based shaper, time-aware shaper, hold and release mechanism, and frame preemption. This letter provides the evaluation of these configurations by means of an analytical discussion and simulation experiments. The results and implications discussed in this letter can serve as useful guidelines for the network designers when configuring TSN networks with regards to the addressed features.

AB Many emerging systems concurrently execute multiple applications that use deep neural network (DNN) as a key portion of the computation. To speedup the execution of such DNNs, various hardware accelerators have been proposed in recent works. Deep learning processor unit (DPU) from Xilinx is one such accelerator targeted for field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based systems. We study the runtime and energy consumption for different DNNs on a range of DPU configurations and derive useful insights. Using these insights, we formulate a design space exploration (DSE) strategy to explore tradeoffs in accuracy, runtime, cost, and energy consumption arising due to flexibility in choosing DNN topology, DPU configuration, and FPGA model. The proposed strategy provides a reduction of 28x in the number of design points to be simulated and 23x in the pruning time.

AB With embedded systems being increasingly networked, appropriate models of computation and communication are needed for specification of such networks-of-systems. Traditional dataflow models have shown their usefulness in analyzing isolated systems. However, these models cannot express the inherent requirements of connected applications, such as dynamic behavior associated with network losses and reactivity to external events. This letter proposes a reactive and adaptive data flow (RADF) model that introduces a notion of empty tokens to expose network losses and provide adaptivity at the application level while maintaining overall determinism. Empty tokens, combined with expanded actor semantics, are also used to model reactivity to sporadic external events. We formally define RADF semantics and show efficient methods for analyzing RADF graphs in terms of their worst-case throughput and latency.

DE Dynamic range improvement; embedded camera trigger; flickering reduction
AB Camera triggering represents an essential step for synchronizing artificial vision systems (AVSs) and can affect the quality of acquired images. In fact, a proper trigger signal is mandatory to synchronize in time both stand alone or multiple cameras covering large environments. In addition, indoor environments with artificial light sources can induce flickering noise in captured frames, affecting the performance of the algorithms that are usually executed to interpret a scene or perform various tasks. In this letter, we describe the design of an embedded system for camera triggering that can be employed to deal with such issues and remove flickering noise while capturing an image with the highest possible dynamic range. Experiments on real data show how the proposed trigger can be effectively employed in AVSs.

ID ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION
AB Robust and reliable detection of falls is crucial especially for elderly activity monitoring systems. In this letter, we present a fall detection system using wearable devices, e.g., smartphones, and tablets, equipped with cameras and accelerometers. Since the portable device is worn by the subject, monitoring is not limited to confined areas, and extends to wherever the subject may travel, as opposed to static sensors installed in certain rooms. Moreover, a camera provides an abundance of information, and the results presented here show that fusing camera and accelerometer data not only increases the detection rate, but also decreases the number of false alarms compared to only accelerometer-based or only camera-based systems. We employ histograms of edge orientations together with the gradient local binary patterns for the camera-based part of fall detection. We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of using original histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) as well as a modified version of HOG. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms using original HOG and modified HOG, and provides lower false positive rates for the camera-based detection. Moreover, we have employed an accelerometer-based fall detection method, and fused these two sensor modalities to have a robust fall detection system. Experimental results and trials with actual Samsung Galaxy phones show that the proposed method, combining two different sensor modalities, provides much higher sensitivity, and a significant decrease in the number of false positives during daily activities, compared to accelerometer-only and camera-only methods.

AB Memristor-based logic-in-memory (LiM) has become popular as a means to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in traditional data-intensive computing. Recently, the memristor-aided logic (MAGIC) design style has gained immense traction for LiM due to its simplicity. However, understanding the energy distribution during the design of logic operations within the memristive memory is crucial in assessing such an implementation's significance. The current energy estimation methods rely on coarse-grained techniques, which underestimate the energy consumption of MAGIC-styled operations performed on a memristor crossbar. To address this issue, we analyze the energy breakdown in MAGIC operations and propose a solution that utilizes mapping from the SIMPLER MAGIC tool to achieve accurate energy estimation through SPICE simulations. In contrast to existing research that primarily focuses on optimizing execution energy, our findings reveal that the memristor's initialization energy in the MAGIC design style is, on average, 68 x higher. We demonstrate that this initialization energy significantly dominates the overall energy consumption. By highlighting this aspect, we aim to redirect the attention of designers toward developing algorithms and strategies that prioritize optimizations in initializations rather than execution for more effective energy savings.

   emulation; FPGA acceleration; prototyping; verification
AB Presilicon forward error correction (FEC) decoding hardware is typically designed using hardware description languages (HDLs). Its verification is a hard task due to its intrinsic tendency to correct errors. The generation and injection of millions of random inputs as well as the cross-checking of the corresponding outputs are highly recommended. Using HDL simulations for such work leads to prohibitive execution times. This letter proposes a verification strategy in which the software testbed is executed on a multicore host and the hardware under verification is prototyped on a PCIe accelerator card. Data are transferred in big blocks of codewords over a high-bandwidth PCIe channel and applied to the decoder using a pipeline management to maximize the use of computational resources and minimize the verification time. The decoder is replicated with parallel access to DDRs. OpenMP is used to leverage the parallel capabilities of the host and OpenCL, together with Xilinx Runtime (XRT) Library, to manage the PCIe FPGA card execution. The results show an important speed-up with respect to HDL simulation and to other prototyping approaches.

AB Design and verification techniques targeting the space environment are widely used to explore the reliability levels of embedded systems for Cubesats. Considering that, we carried out a study to select and to adapt a design flow to be used as a guide for the development of Cubesats. The chosen design and development flow was used in a case study of a board, called Payload-XL, conceived to be the computing module of a Cubesat. The primary purpose of Payload-XL is to validate the big reprogrammable array for versatile environments (BRAVE) FPGA from Nanoxplore, in orbit. Research and development activities were carried out to integrate the GOMX-5 mission through a partnership between the Federal University of Santa Catarina, the European Space Agency, Cobham Gaisler, GMV, CBK, and GomSpace. The results demonstrate that Payload-XL innovates as a validation platform for the BRAVE FPGA and also brings mechanisms to reconfigure it remotely in orbit. Furthermore, the results show that Payload-XL complies with the power, size, and requirements of the GOMX-5 mission.

AB Biophysical signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) are key to the sensing of vital parameters for wellbeing. Coincidentally, both ECG and PPG provide a different window into the same phenomena, namely, the cardiac cycle. However, they are used separately for various health monitoring tasks, which often have safety implications. As these sensors are subject to errors and failures, there is a need to develop methods that consider both sensors so as to enhance the safety of the health monitoring application. Considering this, we present the first approach to establish the key relationships between ECG and PPG signals formally. We combine formal runtime monitoring with statistical analysis and regression analysis for our results.

DE Low time-complexity schedulability test; nonpreemptive earliest deadline
   first (NP-EDF); real-time multi-processor scheduling
AB In real-time embedded systems, nonpreemptive earliest deadline first (NP-EDF) is one of the most popular scheduling algorithms to offer timing guarantees of a set of nonpreemptive real-time jobs (tasks). While most existing schedulability tests for NP-EDF on a multiprocessor platform have paid attention to improving schedulability performance at the expense of increasing time complexity, only a few studies can be used for the situation where low time complexity is critical. In this letter, based on an existing low time-complexity schedulability test for NP-EDF, we develop schedulability tests that improve schedulability performance but maintain low time complexity. Our experiments show that the proposed schedulability tests improve schedulability performance up to 592.4%, compared to the existing low time-complexity one, and they can find some additional task sets schedulable by NP-EDF, which cannot be covered by existing high time-complexity NP-EDF schedulability tests.

ID COGNITIVE RADIO
AB The capability to discriminate signals in the wireless spectrum is significantly crucial in a wide range of practices, such as mesh networks, military, and defense applications. Motivated by these applications, we propose a signal classification scheme deployed in embedded software-defined radio. The proposed work is differentiated by designing the system for over-the-air signals and considering real-life conditions: hardware-constraints and varying channel congestions. The modified Bartlett-based method is unified with a lightweight CNN on a standalone embedded device. Datasets are produced by over-the-air measurements from a WLAN modem that reflects the sparse and dense channel scenarios. The influence of bit resolution and dimension count of the dataset on classification is monitored. We demonstrate the designed system performance across a variety of traffic rates to examine stability. Additionally, several state-of-the-art CNNs are compared with the proposed CNN for accuracy, model complexity, and FLOPS. Our CNN architecture demonstrates immensely nearby accuracy (0.7% - 2.1%) to the rivals despite its exceedingly lightweight architecture.

AB Multikernel operating systems (OSs) were introduced to cope with challenges in software development and deployment in lightweight manycores. Among the possible structures for a multikernel OS, we focus on designs based on asymmetric kernels. This design delivers better performance isolation, but it suffers from an overhead in energy efficiency. In this letter, we overcome this issue with a co-design solution between the cluster of a lightweight manycore and an asymmetric kernel. We designed a 4-core heterogeneous cluster with one core tuned for the OS kernel and we patched the OS kernel to better match the characteristics of this core. Our experiments unveiled that our solution consumes 14.1% less power than the baseline and also improves the OS kernel performance by up to 6.5%.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are collecting data periodically through randomly dispersed sensors (motes) that typically exploit high energy in monitoring a specified application. Furthermore, dissemination mode in WSN usually produces noisy or missing information that affects the behavior of WSN. Data prediction-based filtering is an important approach to reduce redundant data transmissions, conserve node energy, and overcome the defects resulted from data dissemination. Therefore, this letter introduced a novel model was based on a finite impulse response filter integrated with the recursive least squares adaptive filter for improving the signals transferring function by canceling the unwanted noise and reflections accompanying of the transmitted signal and providing high convergence of the transferred signals. The proposed distributed data predictive model (DDPM) was built upon a distributive clustering model for minimizing the amount of transmitted data aimed to decrease the energy consumption in WSN sensor nodes. The results clarified that DDPM reduced the rate of data transmission to 20. Also, it depressed the energy consumption to 95 throughout the dataset sample. DDPM effectively upgraded the performance of the sensory network by about 19, and hence extend its lifetime.

AB Most applications of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) rely on reliable location information. In this letter, we present an embedded communication system for underwater asynchronous localization. An asynchronous localization protocol is developed and encoded for the actual implementation on an embedded communication system. Particularly, the embedded communication system is composed of four transducers, one control center and four acoustic modems. In order to reduce the effect of multipath interference, the direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) technology is applied to the design of modem. Meanwhile, the iterative least squares method is implemented to estimate the position. Finally, experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. It is demonstrated that the influences of asynchronous clock can be well eliminated.

AB Deep learning system composed with multiple levels of layers is increasingly presented in diverse areas nowadays. To achieve good performance, multicore CPUs and accelerators are widely used in real system. Previous study shows that GPU can significantly speed up computation in deep neural networks, while the performance does not scale very well on multicore CPUs. In this letter, we run Caffe on various hardware platforms using different computation setups to train LeNet-5 on MNIST dataset and measure individual time durations of forward and backward passes for each layer. We find that the speedups perform diversely and the scalability of multicore CPU varies when processing different stages of the network. Based on the observation, we show it is worth applying different policies for each layer separately to achieve the overall optimized performance. In addition, our benchmarking results can be used for references to develop dedicated acceleration methods for individual layer of the network.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) sparks a whole new world of embedded applications. Most of these applications are based on deeply embedded systems that have to operate on limited or unreliable sources of energy, such as batteries or energy harvesters. Meeting the energy requirements for such applications is a hard challenge, which threatens the future growth of the IoT. Software has the ultimate control over hardware. Therefore, its role is significant in optimizing the energy consumption of a system. Currently, programmers have no feedback on how their software affects the energy consumption of a system. Such feedback can be enabled by energy transparency, a concept that makes a program's energy consumption visible, from hardware to software. This letter discusses the need for energy transparency in software development and emphasizes on how such transparency can be realized to help tackle the IoT energy challenge.

AB Approximate computing is a design paradigm considered for a range of applications that can tolerate some loss of accuracy. In fact, the bottleneck in conventional digital design techniques can be eliminated to achieve higher performance and energy efficiency by compromising accuracy. In this letter, a new architecture that engages accuracy as a design parameter is presented, where an approximate parallel multiplier using heterogeneous blocks is implemented. Based on design space exploration, we demonstrate that introducing diverse building blocks to implement the multiplier rather than cloning one building block achieves higher precision results. We show experimental results in terms of precision, delay, and power dissipation as metrics and compare with three previous approximate designs. Our results show that the proposed heterogeneous multiplier achieves more precise outputs than the tested circuits while improving performance and power tradeoffs.

   ultralow-power (ULP) embedded multicores
AB The instruction memory hierarchy plays a critical role in performance and energy efficiency of ultralow-power (ULP) processors for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) end-nodes. This is mainly due to the extremely tight power envelope and area budgets, which imply small instruction-caches (I-Cache) operating at very low supply voltages (near-threshold). The challenge is aggravated by the fact that multiple processors, fetching in parallel, require plenty of bandwidth from the I-Caches. In this letter, we propose a low-cost and energy efficient hybrid instruction-prefetching mechanism to be integrated with a ULP multicore cluster. We study its performance for a wide range of IoT applications, from cryptography to computer vision, and show that it can effectively improve the hit-rate of almost all of them to above 95% (average performance improvement of over 2x). In addition, we designed our prefetcher and integrated it in a 4-cores cluster in 28 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology. We show that system's power consumption increases only by about 11% and silicon area by less than 1%. Altogether, a total energy reduction of 1.9x is achieved, thanks to more than 2x performance improvement, enabling a significantly longer battery life.

AB Modern vehicle is equipped with autonomous features, such as precollision system or adaptive cruise control to help people perform driving in a safer and more convenient way. The software complexity of those autonomous features is growing to accommodate various needs from users, which makes it more difficult to test their correctness. Virtual prototyping allows one to test the vehicle software in the virtual road environment. Even though several tools are available, original equipment manufacturers seem to be hesitating to fully integrate the virtual test as a part of the vehicle development plan. One of the obstacle is due to a lack of well-defined test criteria that can reasonably abstract the physical environment and test case generation methods that automatically visualize the virtual road environment. In this letter, we propose several associated research directions and potential approaches from the perspective of test criteria and test case generation.
