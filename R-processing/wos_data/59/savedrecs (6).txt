AB In face recognition, simple classifiers are frequently used. For a robust system, it is common to construct a multi-class classifier by combining the outputs of several binary classifiers; this is called output coding method. The two basic output coding methods for this purpose are known as OnePerClass (OPC) and PairWise Coupling (PWC). The performance of output coding methods depends on accuracy of base dichotomizers. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is suitable for this purpose. In this paper, we review output coding methods and introduce a new sequential fusion method using SVM as a base classifier based on OPC and PWC according to their properties. In the experiments, we compare our proposed method with others. The experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the performance significantly on the real dataset.

AB Usually, paintings are more appealing than photographic images. This is because paintings can incorporate styles based on the artist's subjective view of motif. This style can be distinguished by looking at elements such as motif, color, shape deformation and brush texture. In our work, we focus on the effect of "color" element and devise a method for transforming the color of an input photograph according to a reference painting. To do this, we consider basic color category concepts in the color transformation process. We assume that color transformations from one basic color category to another may cause peculiar feelings. Therefore, we restrict each color transformation within the same basic color category. For this, our algorithm first categorizes each pixel color of a photograph into one of eleven basic color categories. Next, for every pixel color of the photograph, the algorithm finds its corresponding color in the same category of a reference painting. Finally, the algorithm substitutes the pixel color with its corresponding color. In this way, we achieve large but natural color transformations of an image.

AB Feature interaction is the term used in telephony systems to refer to inconsistent conflict between multiple communication services. Feature interaction is considered a major obstacle to developing reliable telephony systems and many approaches have been explored to resolve it. In this paper we present an automatic method for detecting latent feature interaction in service specifications. This method uses bounded model checking as its basis. The basic idea behind bounded model checking is to reduce the detection problem to the propositional satisfiability (SAT) decision problem. For asynchronous systems like telecommunication systems, however, traditional bounded model checking does not work well because resulting propositional formulas tend to become very large. We propose a new encoding scheme to overcome this problem and show the effectiveness through comparative experiments with traditional bounded model checking and other model checking methods.

AB Described here is an automatic text summarization system for Japanese newspaper articles on sassho-jiken (murders and bodily harms). We extract the pieces of information from a text, inter-connect them to represent the scenes and participants involved in the sassho-jiken, and finally produce a summary by generating sentences from the information extracted. An experiment and its evaluation show that, while a limitation being imposed on the domain, our method works well in depicting important information from the newspaper articles and the summaries produced are better in adequacy and readability than those obtained by extracting sentences.

AB A wide variety of visual textures could be successfully modeled as spatially variant by quantitatively describing them through the variation of their local spatial frequency and/or local orientation components. This class of patterns includes flow-like, granular or oriented textures. Modeling is achieved by assuming that locally, textured images contain a single dominant component describing their local spatial frequency and modulating amplitude or contrast. Spatially variant textures are nonhomogeneous in the sense of having nonstationary local spectra, while remaining locally coherent. Segmenting spatially variant textures is the challenging task undertaken in this paper. Usually, the goal of texture segmentation is to split an image into regions with homogeneous textural properties. However, in the case of image regions with spatially variant textures, there is no global homogeneity present and thus segmentation passes through identification of regions with globally nonstationary, but locally coherent, textural content. Local spatial frequency components are accurately estimated using Gabor wavelet outputs along with the absolute magnitude of the convolution of the input image with the first derivatives of the underlying Gabor function. In this paper, a frequency estimation approach is used for segmentation. Indeed, at the boundary between adjacent textures, discontinuities occur in texture local spatial frequency components. These discontinuities are interpreted as corresponding to texture boundaries. Experimental results are in remarkable agreement with human visual perception, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB Computation of scale space images requires numerical integration of partial differential equations, which demands large computational costs especially in nonlinear cases. In this paper, we present a computational scheme for nonlinear scale spaces based on iterated filtering of original images. This scheme is found to be a special case of numerical integration with a particularly adapted integration steplength. We show the stability of the iteration with local windows and that with global ones and analyze the deformation of edge waveforms in the filtering. Computational costs are evaluated experimentally for both local and global windows and finally we apply the nonlinear multi-scale smoothing to contrast enhancement of images.

DE emails; categorization; classification; machine learning; metadata
AB A set of systematic experiments on intelligent email categorization has been conducted with different machine learning algorithms applied to different parts of data in order to achieve the most correct classification. The categorization is based on not only the body but also the header of an email message. The metadata (e.g. sender name, sender organization, etc.) provide additional information that can be exploited to improve the categorization capability. Results of experiments on real email data demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to find the best learning algorithm and the metadata to be used, which is a very significant contribution in email classification. It is also shown that categorization based only on the header information is comparable or superior to that based on all the information in a message for all the learning algorithms considered.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In this paper, we propose a new computer-aided diagnosis system which can extract specific features from hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained breast tumor images and evaluate the type of tumor using artificial organisms. The gene of the artificial organisms is defined by three kinds of texture features, which can evaluate the specific features of the tumor region in the image. The artificial organisms move around in the image and investigate their environmental conditions during the searching process. When the target pixel is regarded as a tumor region, the organism obtains energy and produces offspring; organisms in other regions lose energy and die. The searching process is iterated until the 30th generation; as a result, tumor regions are filled with artificial organisms. Whether the detected tumor is benign or malignant is evaluated based on the combination of selected genes. The method developed was applied to 27 test cases and the distinction between benign and malignant tumors by the artificial organisms was successful in about 90% of tumor images. In this diagnosis support system, the combination of genes, which represents specific features of detected tumor region, is selected automatically for each tumor image during the searching process.

TI Lossless scalable audio coding and quality enhancement
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE lossless; audio coding; scalable; MPEG-4
AB This paper proposes a lossless scalable audio coding scheme and quality enhancement processing at the decoder to compensate for some missing scalable units of information. The bit rate scalability is achieved by combining high-compression coding, such as MPEG-4, and horizontal bit slicing of the PCN4-coded error signal between the original waveform and the locally, reconstructed MPEG-4 signal. The horizontally sliced stream may be transported through an IP network with priority. Even if some units are missing at the decoder, reasonable quality waveform can be reconstructed by means of preserving the important packets. In addition, quality enhancement procedures including scale adjustment and post-processing have been proposed. The scale adjustment eliminates unnecessary zero's, and the post-processing recovers the spectral envelope characteristics of the original input signal. As a result of objective quality evaluation, the two techniques are confirmed to be useful for quality enhancement when lower priority packets are lost. This scheme enables graceful degradation by supporting lossless, near lossless, and high-compression coding within a single scalable framework, and is useful for narrowband to broadband audio streaming.

TI Improvement of Differential-GNSS Positioning by Estimating Code
   Double-Difference-Error Using Machine Learning
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE GNSS; DGNSS; double -difference; machine -learning; deep learning
AB Recently, Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) po-sitioning has been widely used in various applications (e.g. car navigation system, smartphone map application, autonomous driving). In GNSS po-sitioning, coordinates are calculated from observed satellite signals. The observed signals contain various errors, so the calculated coordinates also have some errors. Double-difference is one of the widely used ideas to re-duce the errors of the observed signals. Although double-difference can remove many kinds of errors from the observed signals, some errors still remain (e.g. multipath error). In this paper, we define the remaining error as "double-difference-error (DDE)" and propose a method for estimating DDE using machine learning. In addition, we attempt to improve DGNSS positioning by feeding back the estimated DDE. Previous research apply-ing machine learning to GNSS has focused on classifying whether the sig-nal is LOS (Line Of Sight) or NLOS (Non Line Of Sight), and there is no study that attempts to estimate the amount of error itself as far as we know. Furthermore, previous studies had the limitation that their dataset was recorded at only a few locations in the same city. This is because these studies are mainly aimed at improving the positioning accuracy of vehi-cles, and collecting large amounts of data using vehicles is costly. To avoid this problem, in this research, we use a huge amount of openly available stationary point data for training. Through the experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method can reduce the DGNSS positioning error. Even though the DDE estimator was trained only on stationary point data, the proposed method improved the DGNSS positioning accuracy not only with stationary point but also with mobile rover. In addition, by comparing with the previous (detect and remove) approach, we confirmed the effectiveness of the DDE feedback approach.

TI Policy-Based Method for Applying OAuth 2.0-Based Security Profiles
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE OAuth 2.0; security profile; financial-grade API (FAPI) security
   profile; open banking
AB Two problems occur when an authorization server is utilized for a use case where a different security profile needs to be applied to a unique client request for accessing a distinct type of an API, such as open banking. A security profile can be applied to a client request by using the settings of an authorization server and client. However, this method can only apply the same security profile to all client requests. Therefore, multiple authorization servers or isolated environments, such as realms of an authorization server, are needed to apply a different security profile. However, this increases managerial costs for the authorization server administration. Moreover, new settings and logic need to be added to an authorization server if the existing client settings are inadequate for applying a security profile, which requires modification of an authorization server's source code. We aims to propose the policy-based method that resolves these problems. The proposed method does not completely rely on the settings of a client and can determine an applied security profile using a policy and the context of the client's request. Therefore, only one authorization server or isolated environment, such as a realm of an authorization server, is required to support multiple different security profiles. Additionally, the proposed method can implement a security profile as a pluggable software module. Thus, the source code of the authorization server need not be modified. The proposed method and Financial-grade application programming interface (FAPI) security profiles were implemented in Keycloak, which is an open-source identity and access management solution, and evaluation scenarios were executed. The results of the evaluation confirmed that the proposed method resolves these problems. The implementation has been contributed to Keycloak, making the proposed method and FAPI security profiles publicly available.

DE key Swin Transformer; convolutional neural network; multi-scale dilated

AB Single image deraining is an ill-posed problem which also has been a long-standing issue. In past few years, convolutional neural net-work (CNN) methods almost dominated the computer vision and achieved considerable success in image deraining. Recently the Swin Transformer -based model also showed impressive performance, even surpassed the CNN-based methods and became the state-of-the-art on high-level vision tasks. Therefore, we attempt to introduce Swin Transformer to deraining tasks. In this paper, we propose a deraining model with two sub-networks. The first sub-network includes two branches. Rain Recognition Network is a Unet with the Swin Transformer layer, which works as preliminar-ily restoring the background especially for the location where rain streaks appear. Detail Complement Network can extract the background detail be-neath the rain streak. The second sub-network which called Refine-Unet utilizes the output of the previous one to further restore the image. Through experiments, our network achieves improvements on single image derain-ing compared with the previous Transformer research.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop a practical functional electrical stimulation (FES) controller for joint movements restoration based on an optimal control technique by cascading a linear model predictive control (MPC) and a nonlinear transformation. The cascading configuration was aimed to obtain an FES controller that is able to deal with a nonlinear system. The nonlinear transformation was utilized to transform the linear solution of linear MPC to become a nonlinear solution in form of optimized electrical stimulation intensity. Four different types of nonlinear functions were used to realize the nonlinear transformation. A simple parameter estimation to determine the value of the nonlinear transformation parameter was also developed. The tracking control capability of the proposed controller along with the parameter estimation was examined in controlling the 1-DOF wrist joint movement through computer simulation. The proposed controller was also compared with a fuzzy FES controller. The proposed MPC-FES controller with estimated parameter value worked properly and had a better control accuracy than the fuzzy controller. The parameter estimation was suggested to be useful and effective in practical FES control applications to reduce the time-consuming of determining the parameter value of the proposed controller.

AB To enhance the emotion feature and improve the performance of speech emotion recognition, an attention mechanism is employed to recognize the important information in both time and feature dimensions. In the time dimension, multi-heads attention is modified with the last state of the long short-term memory (LSTM)'s output to match the time accumulation characteristic of LSTM. In the feature dimension, scaled dot-product attention is replaced with additive attention that refers to the method of the state update of LSTM to construct multi-heads attention. This means that a nonlinear change replaces the linear mapping in classical multi-heads attention. Experiments on IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the attention mechanism could enhance emotional information and improve the performance of speech emotion recognition.

AB To overcome the challenge in micro-expression recogni-tion that it only emerge in several small facial regions with low intensity, some researchers proposed facial region partition mechanisms and intro-duced group sparse learning methods for feature selection. However, such methods have some shortcomings, including the complexity of region divi-sion and insufficient utilization of critical facial regions. To address these problems, we propose a novel Group Sparse Reduced Rank Tensor Re-gression (GSRRTR) to transform the fearure matrix into a tensor by lay-ing blocks and features in different dimensions. So we can process grids and texture features separately and avoid interference between grids and features. Furthermore, with the use of Tucker decomposition, the feature tensor can be decomposed into a product of core tensor and a set of ma-trix so that the number of parameters and the computational complexity of the scheme will decreased. To evaluate the performance of the proposed micro-expression recognition method, extensive experiments are conducted on two micro expression databases: CASME2 and SMIC. The experimen-tal results show that the proposed method achieves comparable recognition rate with less parameters than state-of-the-art methods.

AB This study examined whether distance learning in a first -year PBL courses in the first unit of instruction improves the effectiveness of subsequent group work learning over face-to-face learning. The first -year PBL consisted of three units: an input unit, a group work unit and an outcomes presentation unit. In 2017/2018, the input unit was conducted in the classroom with face-to-face learning. In 2017, a workshop was held in addition to face-to-face learning in classroom. In 2020/2021, the input unit was conducted with distance learning. In the years, approximately 100 people completed the questionnaire. A preliminary check confirmed that the average score of students' self-assessment of their own social skills were not significantly different among the four years. Analysis showed that in 2018, the perceived efficacy in the group work unit depended on learners' high social skills. Alternatively, in 2017/2020/2021, the perceived efficacy in group work was not dependent on learners' social skills. This suggests that distance learning and face-to-face learning with workshop learning, instead of full face-to-face learning for the units placed before the group work unit facilitates the learning efficacy of the group work unit, even for students with social skill concerns.

AB Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a basic neural network model that is used in practical industrial applications, such as network in-trusion detection (NID) systems. It is also used as a building block in newer models, such as gMLP. Currently, there is a demand for fast training in NID and other areas. However, in training with numerous GPUs, the problems of power consumption and long training times arise. Many of the latest deep neural network (DNN) models and MLPs are trained using a back -propagation algorithm which transmits an error gradient from the output layer to the input layer such that in the sequential computation, the next input cannot be processed until the weights of all layers are updated from the last layer. This is known as backward locking. In this study, a weight parameter update mechanism is proposed with time delays that can accom-modate the weight update delay to allow simultaneous forward and back-ward computation. To this end, a one-dimensional systolic array structure was designed on a Xilinx U50 Alveo FPGA card in which each layer of the MLP is assigned to a processing element (PE). The time-delay backpropa-gation algorithm executes all layers in parallel, and transfers data between layers in a pipeline. Compared to the Intel Core i9 CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, it is 3 times faster than the CPU and 2.5 times faster than the GPU. The processing speed per power consumption is 11.5 times better than that of the CPU and 21.4 times better than that of the GPU. From these results, it is concluded that a training accelerator on an FPGA can achieve high speed and energy efficiency.

AB With the development of blockchain technology, the automatic generation of smart contract has become a hot research topic. The existing smart contract automatic generation technology still has improvement spaces in complex process, third-party specialized tools required, specific the compatibility of code and running environment. In this paper, we propose an automatic smart contract generation method, which is domain-oriented and configuration-based. It is designed and implemented with the application scenarios of government service. The process of configuration, public state database definition, code generation and formal verification are included. In the Hyperledger Fabric environment, the applicability of the generated smart contract code is verified. Furthermore, its quality and security are formally verified with the help of third-party testing tools. The experimental results show that the quality and security of the generated smart contract code meet the expect standards. The automatic smart contract generation will "elegantly" be applied on the work of anti-disclosure, privacy protection, and prophecy processing in government service. To effectively enable develop "programmable government ".

AB Speech separation is the task of extracting target speech while suppressing background interference components. In applications like video telephones, visual information about the target speaker is available, which can be leveraged for multi-speaker speech separation. Most previous multi-speaker separation methods are mainly based on convolutional or recurrent neural networks. Recently, Transformer-based Seq2Seq models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, such as neural machine translation (NMT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), etc. Transformer has showed an advantage in modeling audio-visual temporal context by multi-head attention blocks through explicitly assigning attention weights. Besides, Transformer doesn't have any recurrent sub-networks, thus supporting parallelization of sequence computation. In this paper, we propose a novel speaker-independent audio-visual speech separation method based on Transformer, which can be flexibly applied to unknown number and identity of speakers. The model receives both audiovisual streams, including noisy spectrogram and speaker lip embeddings, and predicts a complex time-frequency mask for the corresponding target speaker. The model is made up by three main components: audio encoder, visual encoder and Transformer-based mask generator. Two different structures of encoders are investigated and compared, including ResNet-based and Transformer-based. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of source separation and speech quality metrics. The experimental results on the benchmark GRID dataset show the effectiveness of the method on speaker-independent separation task in multi-talker environments. The model generalizes well to unseen identities of speakers and noise types. Though only trained on 2-speaker mixtures, the model achieves reasonable performance when tested on 2-speaker and 3-speaker mixtures. Besides, the model still shows an advantage compared with previous audio-visual speech separation works.

TI Anomaly Prediction for Wind Turbines Using an Autoencoder with Vibration
   Data Supported by Power-Curve Filtering

AB The prediction of the malfunction timing of wind turbines is essential for maintaining the high profitability of the wind power generation industry. Studies have been conducted on machine learning methods that use condition monitoring system data, such as vibration data, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data to detect and predict anomalies in wind turbines automatically. Autoencoder-based techniques that use unsupervised learning where the anomaly pattern is unknown have attracted significant interest in the area of anomaly detection and prediction. In particular, vibration data are considered useful because they include the changes that occur in the early stages of a malfunction. However, when autoencoder-based techniques are applied for prediction purposes, in the training process it is difficult to distinguish the difference between operating and non-operating condition data, which leads to the degradation of the prediction performance. In this letter, we propose a method in which both vibration data and SCADA data are utilized to improve the prediction performance, namely, a method that uses a power curve composed of active power and wind speed. We evaluated the method's performance using vibration and SCADA data obtained from an actual wind farm.

TI A Novel Discriminative Virtual Label Regression Method for Unsupervised
   Feature Selection

AB Unsupervised Feature selection is an important dimensionality reduction technique to cope with high-dimensional data. It does not require prior label information, and has recently attracted much attention. However, it cannot fully utilize the discriminative information of samples, which may affect the feature selection performance. To tackle this problem, in this letter, we propose a novel discriminative virtual label regression method (DVLR) for unsupervised feature selection. In DVLR, we develop a virtual label regression function to guide the subspace learning based feature selection, which can select more discriminative features. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) term is used to make the model be more discriminative. To further make the model be more robust and select more representative features, we impose the l(2,1)-norm on the regression and feature selection terms. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on several public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed DVLR achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.

AB Local discriminative regions play important roles in fine-grained image analysis tasks. How to locate local discriminative regions with only category label and learn discriminative representation from these regions have been hot spots. In our work, we propose Searching Discriminative Regions (SDR) and Learning Discriminative Regions (LDR) method to search and learn local discriminative regions in images. The SDR method adopts attention mechanism to iteratively search for highresponse regions in images, and uses this as a clue to locate local discriminative regions. Moreover, the LDR method is proposed to learn compact within category and sparse between categories representation from the raw image and local images. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves excellent performance in both fine-grained image retrieval and classification tasks, which demonstrates its effectiveness.

AB Recently, edge servers located closer than the cloud have become expected for the purpose of processing the large amount of sensor data generated by IoT devices such as robots. Research has been proposed to improve responsiveness as a cache server by applying KVS (KeyValue Store) to the edge as a method for obtaining high responsiveness. Above all, a hybrid-KVS server that uses both DRAM and NVMM (NonVolatile Main Memory) devices is expected to achieve both responsiveness and reliability. However, its effectiveness has not been verified in actual applications, and its effectiveness is not clear in terms of its relationship with the cloud. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid-KVS servers using the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), which is a widely used application in robots and autonomous driving. It is appropriate for applying an edge server and requires responsiveness and reliability. SLAM is generally implemented on ROS (Robot Operating System) middleware and communicates with the server through ROS middleware. However, if we use hybrid-KVS on the edge with the SLAM and ROS, the communication could not be achieved since the message objects are different from the format expected by KVS. Therefore, in this research, we propose a mechanism to apply the ROS memory object to hybrid-KVS by designing and implementing the data serialization function to extend ROS. As a result of the proposed fogcached-ros and evaluation, we confirm the effectiveness of low API overhead, support for data used by SLAM, and low latency difference between the edge and cloud.

TI Usage Log-Based Testing of Embedded Software and Identification of
   Dependencies among Environmental Components
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE embedded software testing; environmental modeling; test coverage
AB Embedded software often interacts with multiple inputs from various sensors whose dependency is often complex or partially known to developers. With incomplete information on dependency, testing is likely to be insufficient in detecting errors. We propose a method to enhance testing coverage of embedded software by identifying subtle and often neglected dependencies using information contained in usage log. Usage log, traditionally used primarily for investigative purpose following accidents, can also make useful contribution during testing of embedded software. Our approach relies on first individually developing behavioral model for each environmental input, performing compositional analysis while identifying feasible but untested dependencies from usage log, and generating additional test cases that correspond to untested or insufficiently tested dependencies. Experimental evaluation was performed on an Android application named Gravity Screen as well as an Arduino-based wearable glove app. Whereas conventional CTM-based testing technique achieved average branch coverage of 26% and 68% on these applications, respectively, proposed technique achieved 100% coverage in both.

TI Detecting Depression from Speech through an Attentive LSTM Network
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE depression detection; LSTM; attention mechanism; vocal expression
AB Depression endangers people's health conditions and affects the social order as a mental disorder. As an efficient diagnosis of depression, automatic depression detection has attracted lots of researcher's interest. This study presents an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for depression detection to make full use of the difference between depression and non-depression between timeframes. The proposed model uses frame-level features, which capture the temporal information of depressive speech, to replace traditional statistical features as an input of the LSTM layers. To achieve more multi-dimensional deep feature representations, the LSTM output is then passed on attention layers on both time and feature dimensions. Then, we concat the output of the attention layers and put the fused feature representation into the fully connected layer. At last, the fully connected layer's output is passed on to softmax layer. Experiments conducted on the DAIC-WOZ database demonstrate that the proposed attentive LSTM model achieves an average accuracy rate of 90.2% and outperforms the traditional LSTM network and LSTM with local attention by 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, which indicates its feasibility.

AB In this paper, we present an efficient and robust method for estimating Homography matrix for soccer field registration between a captured camera image and a soccer field model. The presented method first detects reliable field lines from the camera image through clustering. Constructing a novel directional feature of the intersection points of the lines in both the camera image and the model, the presented method then finds matching pairs of these points between the image and the model. Finally, Homography matrix estimations and validations are performed using the obtained matching pairs, which can reduce the required number of Homography matrix calculations. Our presented method uses possible intersection points outside image for the point matching. This effectively improves robustness and accuracy of Homography estimation as demonstrated in experimental results.

AB A nonvolatile field-programmable gate array (NV-FPGA), where the circuit-configuration information still remains without power supply, offers a powerful solution against the standby power issue. In this paper, an NV-FPGA is proposed where the programmable logic and interconnect function blocks are described in a hardware description language and are pushed through a standard-cell-based design flow with nonvolatile flip-flops. The use of the standard-cell-based design flow makes it possible to migrate any arbitrary process technology and to perform architecture-level simulation with physical information. As a typical example, the proposed NV-FPGA is designed under 55nm CMOS/100nm magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) technologies, and the performance of the proposed NVFPGA is evaluated in comparison with that of a CMOS-only volatile FPGA.

AB Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is now a widely disseminated weight-sharing neural architecture search method and it consists of two stages: search and evaluation. However, the original DARTS suffers from some well-known shortcomings. Firstly, the width and depth of the network, as well as the operation of two stages are discontinuous, which causes a performance collapse. Secondly, DARTS has a high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a synchronous progressive approach to solve the discontinuity problem for network depth and width and we use the 0-1 loss function to alleviate the discontinuity problem caused by the discretization of operation. The computational overhead is reduced by using the partial channel connection. Besides, we also discuss and propose a solution to the aggregation of skip operations during the search process of DARTS. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 andWANFANG datasets, specifically, our approach reduces search time significantly (from 1.5 to 0.1 GPU days) and improves the accuracy of image recognition.

TI Multi-View Texture Learning for Face Super-Resolution
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE multi-view face image; texture compensation; face super-resolution; deep
   learning
AB In recent years, single face image super-resolution (SR) using deep neural networks have been well developed. However, most of the face images captured by the camera in a real scene are from different views of the same person, and the existing traditionalmulti-frame image SR requires alignment between images. Due to multi-view face images contain texture information from different views, which can be used as effective prior information, how to use this prior information from multi-views to reconstruct frontal face images is challenging. In order to effectively solve the above problems, we propose a novel face SR network based on multi-view face images, which focus on obtaining more texture information from multi-view face images to help the reconstruction of frontal face images. And in this network, we also propose a texture attention mechanism to transfer high-precision texture compensation information to the frontal face image to obtain better visual effects. We conduct subjective and objective evaluations, and the experimental results show the great potential of using multi-view face images SR. The comparison with other state-of-the-art deep learning SR methods proves that the proposed method has excellent performance.

AB The performance of online algorithms for the bin packing problem is usually measured by the asymptotic approximation ratio. However, even if an online algorithm is explicitly described, it is in general difficult to obtain the exact value of the asymptotic approximation ratio. In this paper we show a theorem that gives the exact value of the asymptotic approximation ratio in a closed form when the item sizes and the online algorithm satisfy some conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that our theorem serves as a powerful tool for the design of online algorithms combined with mathematical optimization.

AB We have developed an adaptation method which allows the customization of example-based dialog systems for individual users by applying "plus" and "minus" operations to the distributed representations obtained using the word2vec method. After retrieving user-related profile information from the Web, named entity extraction is applied to the retrieval results. Words with a high term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score are then adopted as user related words. Next, we calculate the similarity between the distrubuted representations of selected user-related words and nouns in the existing example phrases, using word2vec embedding. We then generate phrases adapted to the user by substituting user-related words for highly similar words in the original example phrases. Word2vec also has a special property which allows the arithmetic operations "plus" and "minus" to be applied to distributed word representations. By applying these operations to words used in the original phrases, we are able to determine which user-related words can be used to replace the original words. The user-related words are then substituted to create customized example phrases. We evaluated the naturalness of the generated phrases and found that the system could generate natural phrases.

AB The eyes are continuously fluctuating during fixation. These fluctuations are called fixational eye movements. Fixational eye movements consist of tremors, microsaccades, and ocular drifts. Fixational eye movements aid our vision by shaping spatial-temporal characteristics. Here, it is known that photoreceptors, the first input layer of the retinal network, have a spatially non-uniform cell alignment called the cone mosaic. The roles of fixational eye movements are being gradually uncovered; however, the effects of the cone mosaic are not considered. Here we constructed a large-scale visual system model to explore the effect of the cone mosaic on the visual signal processing associated with fixational eye movements. The visual system model consisted of a brainstem, eye optics, and photoreceptors. In the simulation, we focused on the roles of fixational eye movements on signal processing with sparse sampling by photoreceptors given their spatially non-uniform mosaic. To analyze quantitatively the effect of fixational eye movements, the capacity of information processing in the simulated photoreceptor responses was evaluated by information rate. We confirmed that the information rate by sparse sampling due to the cone mosaic was increased with fixational eye movements. We also confirmed that the increase of the information rate was derived from the increase of the responses for the edges of objects. These results suggest that visual information is already enhanced at the level of the photoreceptors by fixational eye movements.

AB With our ever increasing dependence on computers, many governments around the world have started to investigate strengthening the regulations on vulnerabilities and their lifecycle management. Although many previous works have studied this problem space for mainstream software packages and web applications, relatively few have studied this for consumer IoT devices. As our first step towards filling this void, this paper presents a pilot study on the vulnerability disclosures and patch releases of three prominent consumer IoT vendors in Japan and three in the United States. Our goals include (i) characterizing the trends and risks in the vulnerability lifecycle management of consumer IoT devices using accurate long-term data, and (ii) identifying problems, challenges, and potential approaches for future studies of this problem space. To this end, we collected all published vulnerabilities and patches related to the consumer IoT products by the included vendors between 2006 and 2017; then, we analyzed our dataset from multiple perspectives, such as the severity of the included vulnerabilities and the timing of the included patch releases with respect to the corresponding disclosures and exploits. Our work has uncovered several important findings that may inform future studies. These findings include (i) a stark contrast between how the vulnerabilities in our dataset were disclosed in the two markets, (ii) three alarming practices by the included vendors that may significantly increase the risk of 1-day exploits for customers, and (iii) challenges in data collection including crawling automation and long-term data availability. For each finding, we also provide discussions on its consequences and/or potential migrations or suggestions.

TI ROPminer: Learning-Based Static Detection of ROP Chain Considering
   Linkability of ROP Gadgets
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE return-oriented programming; static detection; machine learning
AB Return-oriented programming (ROP) has been crucial for attackers to evade the security mechanisms of recent operating systems. Although existing ROP detection approaches mainly focus on host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSes), network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSes) are also desired to protect various hosts including IoT devices on the network. However, existing approaches are not enough for network-level protection due to two problems: (1) Dynamic approaches take the time with second- or minute-order on average for inspection. For applying to NIDSes, millisecond-order is required to achieve near real time detection. (2) Static approaches generate false positives because they use heuristic patterns. For applying to NIDSes, false positives should be minimized to suppress false alarms. In this paper, we propose a method for statically detecting ROP chains in malicious data by learning the target libraries (i.e., the libraries that are used for ROP gadgets). Our method accelerates its inspection by exhaustively collecting feasible ROP gadgets in the target libraries and learning them separated from the inspection step. In addition, we reduce false positives inevitable for existing static inspection by statically verifying whether a suspicious byte sequence can link properly when they are executed as a ROP chain. Experimental results showed that our method has achieved millisecond-order ROP chain detection with high precision.

AB Action recognition using skeleton data (3D coordinates of human joints) is an attractive topic due to its robustness to the actor's appearance, camera's viewpoint, illumination, and other environmental conditions. However, skeleton data must be measured by a depth sensor or extracted from video data using an estimation algorithm, and doing so risks extraction errors and noise. In this work, for robust skeleton-based action recognition, we propose a deep state-space model (DSSM). The DSSM is a deep generative model of the underlying dynamics of an observable sequence. We applied the proposed DSSM to skeleton data, and the results demonstrate that it improves the classification performance of a baseline method. Moreover, we confirm that feature extraction with the proposed DSSM renders subsequent classifications robust to noise and missing values. In such experimental settings, the proposed DSSM outperforms a state-of-the-art method.

AB The outcome of document clustering depends on the scheme used to assign a weight to each term in a document. While recent works have tried to use distributions related to class to enhance the discrimination ability. It is worth exploring whether a deviation approach or an entropy approach is more effective. This paper presents a comparison between deviation-based distribution and entropy-based distribution as constraints in term weighting. In addition, their potential combinations are investigated to find optimal solutions in guiding the clustering process. In the experiments, the seeded k-means method is used for clustering, and the performances of deviation-based, entropy-based, and hybrid approaches, are analyzed using two English and one Thai text datasets. The result showed that the deviation-based distribution outperformed the entropy-based distribution, and a suitable combination of these distributions increases the clustering accuracy by 10%.

AB To prevent proxy-test taking among examinees in unsynchronized e-Testing, a previous work proposed an online handwriting authentication. That method was limited to applied for end of each answer. For free response tests that needed to authenticate throughout the answer, we used the Bayesian prior information to examine a sequential handwriting authentication procedure. The evaluation results indicate that the accuracy of this procedure is higher than the previous method in examinees authentication during mathematics exam with referring the Chinese character.

AB In this article, we propose a method to identify the link layer home network topology, motivated by applications to cost reduction of support centers. If the topology of home networks can be identified automatically and efficiently, it is easier for operators of support centers to identify fault points. We use MAC address forwarding tables (AFTs) which can be collected from network devices. There are a couple of existing methods for identifying a network topology using AFTs, but they are insufficient for our purpose; they are not applicable to some specific network topologies that are typical in home networks. The advantage of our method is that it can handle such topologies. We also implemented these three methods and compared their running times. The result showed that, despite its wide applicability, our method is the fastest among the three.

AB This letter presents a novel technique to achieve a fast inference of the binarized convolutional neural networks (BCNN). The proposed technique modifies the structure of the constituent blocks of the BCNN model so that the input elements for the max-pooling operation are binary. In this structure, if any of the input elements is +1, the result of the pooling can be produced immediately; the proposed technique eliminates such computations that are involved to obtain the remaining input elements, so as to reduce the inference time effectively. The proposed technique reduces the inference time by up to 34.11%, while maintaining the classification accuracy.

TI Automatic Construction of a Large-Scale Speech Recognition Database
   Using Multi-Genre Broadcast Data with Inaccurate Subtitle Timestamps
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE data refinement; broadcast data; acoustic model; speech recognition
AB As deep learning-based speech recognition systems are spotlighted, the need for large-scale speech databases for acoustic model training is increasing. Broadcast data can be easily used for database construction, since it contains transcripts for the hearing impaired. However, the subtitle timestamps have not been used to extract speech data because they are often inaccurate due to the inherent characteristics of closed captioning. Thus, we propose to build a large-scale speech database from multi-genre broadcast data with inaccurate subtitle timestamps. The proposed method first extracts the most likely speech intervals by removing subtitle texts with low subtitle quality index, concatenating adjacent subtitle texts into a merged subtitle text, and adding a margin to the timestamp of the merged subtitle text. Next, a speech recognizer is used to extract a hypothesis text of a speech segment corresponding to the merged subtitle text, and then the hypothesis text obtained from the decoder is recursively aligned with the merged subtitle text. Finally, the speech database is constructed by selecting the sub-parts of the merged subtitle text that match the hypothesis text. Our method successfully refines a large amount of broadcast data with inaccurate subtitle timestamps, taking about half of the time compared with the previous methods. Consequently, our method is useful for broadcast data processing, where bulk speech data can be collected every hour.

TI Rootkit inside GPU Kernel Execution
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE graphics processing unit; security; rootkit
AB We propose a rootkit installation method inside a GPU kernel execution process which works through GPU context manipulation. In GPU-based applications such as deep learning computations and cryptographic operations, the proposed method uses the feature by which the execution flow of the GPU kernel obeys the GPU context information in GPU memory. The proposed method consists of two key ideas. The first is GPU code manipulation, which is able to hijack the execution flow of the original GPU kernel to execute an injected payload without affecting the original GPU computation result. The second is a self-page-table update execution during which the GPU kernel updates its page table to access any location in system memory. After the installation, the malicious payload is executed only in the GPU kernel, and any no evidence remains in system memory. Thus, it cannot be detected by conventional rootkit detection methods.

AB To the best of our knowledge, there are a few researches on air-handwriting character-level writer identification only employing acceleration and angular velocity data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to writer identification only using inertial sensor data of air-handwriting. In particular, we separate different representations of degree of freedom (DoF) of air-handwriting to extract local dependency and interrelationship in different CNNs separately. Experiments on a public dataset achieve an average good performance without any extra hand-designed feature extractions.

TI Multi Model-Based Distillation for Sound Event Detection

DT Article
DE sound event detection; model distillation; model compression;

AB Sound event detection is intended to identify the sound events in audio recordings, which has widespread applications in real life. Recently, convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task due to their capabilities in learning the representative features. However, the CRNN models are of high complexities with millions of parameters to be trained, which limits their usage for the mobile and embedded devices with limited computation resource. Model distillation is effective to distill the knowledge of a complex model to a smaller one, which can be deployed on the devices with limited computational power. In this letter, we propose a novel multi model-based distillation approach for sound event detection by making use of the knowledge from models of multiple teachers which are complementary in detecting sound events. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach achieves a compression ratio about 50 times. In addition, better performance is obtained for the sound event detection task.

AB Software diversity can be utilized in cyberspace security to defend against the zero-day attacks. Existing researches have proved the effectiveness of diversity in bringing security benefits, but few of them touch the problem that whether there is a positive correlation between the security and the diversity. In addition, there is little guidance on how to construct an effective diversified system. For that, this paper develops two diversity metrics based on system attribute matrix, proposes a diversity measurement and verifies the effectiveness of the measurement. Through several simulations on the diversified systems which use voting strategy, the relationship between diversity and security is analyzed. The results show that there is an overall positive correlation between security and diversity. Though some cases are against the correlation, further analysis is made to explain the phenomenon. In addition, the effect of voting strategy is also discussed through simulations. The results show that the voting strategy have a dominant impact on the security, which implies that security benefits can be obtained only with proper strategies. According to the conclusions, some guidance is provided in constructing a more diversified as well as securer system.

AB Forecasting commodity futures price is a challenging task. We present an algorithm to predict the trend of commodity futures price based on a type of structuring data and back propagation neural network. The random volatility of futures can be filtered out in the structuring data. Moreover, it is not restricted by the type of futures contract. Experiments show the algorithm can achieve 80% accuracy in predicting price trends.

AB With advances in information technology and the development of big data, manual operation is unlikely to be a smart choice for stock market investing. Instead, the computer-based investment model is expected to bring investors more accurate strategic analysis and more effective investment decisions than human beings. This paper aims to improve investor profits by mining for critical information in the stock data, therefore helping big data analysis. We used the R language to find the technical indicators in the stock market, and then applied the technical indicators to the prediction. The proposed R package includes several analysis toolkits, such as trend line indicators, W type reversal patterns, V type reversal patterns, and the bull or bear market. The simulation results suggest that the developed R package can accurately present the tendency of the price and enhance the return on investment.

   Approximation

AB This paper is concerned with a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approach to selecting a subset of relevant features from among many candidates. For ordinal classification, a sequential logit model and an ordered logit model are often employed. For feature subset selection in the sequential logit model, Sato et al. [22] recently proposed a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) formulation. In their MILO formulation, a univariate nonlinear function contained in the sequential logit model was represented by a tangent-line-based approximation. We extend this MILO formulation toward the ordered logit model, which is more commonly used for ordinal classification than the sequential logit model is. Making use of tangent planes to approximate a bivariate nonlinear function involved in the ordered logit model, we derive an MILO formulation for feature subset selection in the ordered logit model. Our computational results verify that the proposed method is superior to the L1-regularized ordered logit model in terms of solution quality.

AB In recent years we have witnessed an increasing demand to process queries on large datasets in Non-ordered Discrete Data Spaces (NDDS). In particular, one type of query in an NDDS, called box queries, is used in many emerging applications including error corrections in bioinformatics and network intrusion detection in cybersecurity. Effective indexing methods are necessary for efficiently processing queries on large datasets in disk. However, most existing NDDS indexing methods were not designed for box queries. Several recent indexing methods developed for box queries on a large NDDS dataset in disk are based on the popular data-partitioning approach. Unfortunately, a space-partitioning based indexing scheme, which is more effective for box queries in an NDDS, has not been studied before. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing method based on space-partitioning, called the BINDS-tree, for supporting efficient box queries on a large NDDS dataset in disk. A number of effective strategies such as node split based on minimum span and cross optimal balance, redundancy reduction utilizing a singleton dimension inheritance property, and a space-efficient structure for the split history are incorporated in the constructing algorithm for the BINDS-tree. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BINDS-tree significantly improves the box query I/ O performance, comparing to that of the state-of-the-art data-partitioning based NDDS indexing method.

AB This study presents a joint dictionary learning approach for speech emotion recognition named locality preserved joint nonnegative matrix factorization (LP-JNMF). The learned representations are shared between the learned dictionaries and annotation matrix. Moreover, a locality penalty term is incorporated into the objective function. Thus, the system's discriminability is further improved.

AB In the current era of data science, data quality has a significant and critical impact on business operations. This is no different for the meteorological data encountered in the field of meteorology. However, the conventional methods of meteorological data quality control mainly focus on error detection and null-value detection; that is, they only consider the results of the data output but ignore the quality problems that may also arise in the workflow. To rectify this issue, this paper proposes the Total Meteorological Data Quality (TMDQ) framework based on the Total Quality Management (TQM) perspective, especially considering the systematic nature of data warehousing and process focus needs. In practical applications, this paper uses the proposed framework as the basis for the development of a system to help meteorological observers improve and maintain the quality of meteorological data in a timely and efficient manner. To verify the feasibility of the proposed framework and demonstrate its capabilities and usage, it was implemented in the Tamsui Meteorological Observatory (TMO) in Taiwan. The four quality dimension indicators established through the proposed framework will help meteorological observers grasp the various characteristics of meteorological data from different aspects. The application and research limitations of the proposed framework are discussed and possible directions for future research are presented.

AB Background: The applying of third-party libraries is an integral part of many applications. But the libraries choosing is time-onsuming even for experienced developers. The automated recommendation system for libraries recommendation is widely researched to help developers to choose libraries. Aim: from software engineering aspect, our research aims to give developers a reliable recommended list of third-arty libraries at the early phase of software development lifecycle to help them build their development environment faster; and from technical aspect, our research aims to build a generalizable recommendation system framework which combines collaborative filtering and topic modeling techniques, in order to improve the performance of libraries recommendation significantly. Our works on this research: 1) we design a hybrid methodology to combine collaborative filtering and LDA text mining technology; 2) we build a recommendation system framework successfully based on the above hybrid methodology; 3) we make a well-designed experiment to validate the methodology and framework which use the data of 1,013 mobile application projects; 4) we do the evaluation for the result of the experiment. Conclusions: 1) hybrid methodology with collaborative filtering and LDA can improve the performance of libraries recommendation significantly; 2) based on the hybrid methodology, the framework works very well on the libraries recommendation for helping developers' libraries choosing. Further research is necessary to improve the performance of the libraries recommendation including: 1) use more accurate NLP technologies improve the correlation analysis; 2) try other similarity calculation methodology for collaborative filtering to rise the accuracy; 3) on this research, we just bring the time-series approach to the framework and make an experiment as comparative trial, the result shows that the performance improves continuously, so in further research we plan to use time-series data-mining as the basic methodology to update the framework.

ID MODEL
AB Learning semantic representation for translation context is beneficial to statistical machine translation (SMT). Previous efforts have focused on implicitly encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge in translation context by neural networks, which are weak in capturing explicit structural syntax information. In this paper, we propose a new neural network with a tree-based convolutional architecture to explicitly learn structural syntax information in translation context, thus improving translation prediction. Specifically, we first convert parallel sentences with source parse trees into syntax-based linear sequences based on a minimum syntax subtree algorithm, and then define a tree-based convolutional network over the linear sequences to learn syntax-based context representation and translation prediction jointly. To verify the effectiveness, the proposed model is integrated into phrase-based SMT. Experiments on large-scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation tasks show that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial and significant improvement over several baseline systems.

AB Recent researches on mobile robots show that convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved impressive performance in visual place recognition especially for large-scale dynamic environment. However, CNN leads to the large space of image representation that cannot meet the real-time demand for robot navigation. Aiming at this problem, we evaluate the feature effectiveness of feature maps obtained from the layer of CNN by variance and propose a novel method that reserve salient feature maps and make adaptive binarization for them. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared with state of the art methods for visual place recognition, our method not only has no significant loss in precision, but also greatly reduces the space of image representation.

AB Dai-Yuan (DY) conjugate gradient method is an effective method for solving large-scale unconstrained optimization problems. In this paper, a new DY method, possessing a spectral conjugate parameter beta(k), is presented. An attractive property of the proposed method is that the search direction generated at each iteration is descent, which is independent of the line search. Global convergence of the proposed method is also established when strong Wolfe conditions are employed. Finally, comparison experiments on impulse noise removal are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE compression image restoration; subspace regression learning; non-local
   means denoising; extreme support vector regression
AB In this letter, an effective low bit-rate image restoration method is proposed, in which image denoising and subspace regression learning are combined. The proposed framework has two parts: image main structure estimation by classical NLM denoising and texture component prediction by subspace joint regression learning. The local regression function are learned from denoised patch to original patch in each subspace, where the corresponding compression image patches are employed to generate anchoring points by the dictionary learning approach. Moreover, we extent Extreme Support Vector Regression (ESVR) as multivariable nonlinear regression to get more robustness results. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared with other leading methods.

AB High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) has a better coding efficiency comparing with H.264/AVC. However, performance enhancement results in increased computational complexity which is mainly brought by the quadtree based coding tree unit (CTU). In this paper, an early termination algorithm based on AdaBoost classifier for coding unit (CU) is proposed to accelerate the process of searching the best partition for CTU. Experiment results indicate that our method can save 39% computational complexity on average at the cost of increasing Bjontegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) by 0.18.

ID DESIGN
AB Event-centered information integration is regarded as one of the most pressing issues in improving disaster emergency management. Ontology plays an increasingly important role in emergency information integration, and provides the possibility for emergency reasoning. However, the development of event ontology for disaster emergency is a laborious and difficult task due to the increasingly scale and complexity of emergencies. Ontology pattern is a modeling solution to solve the recurrent ontology design problem, which can improve the efficiency of ontology development by reusing patterns. By study on characteristics of numerous emergencies, this paper proposes a generic ontology pattern for emergency system modeling. Based on the emergency ontology pattern, a set of reasoning rules for emergency-evolution, emergency-solution and emergency-resource utilization reasoning were proposed to conduct emergency knowledge reasoning and q.

AB The commonly used Deep Q Networks is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It's also proved that overestimations do harm to performance, which might cause instability and divergence of learning. In this paper, we present the Deep Sarsa and Q Networks (DSQN) algorithm, which can considered as an enhancement to the Deep Q Networks algorithm. First, DSQN algorithm takes advantage of the experience replay and target network techniques in Deep Q Networks to improve the stability of neural networks. Second, double estimator is utilized for Q-learning to reduce overestimations. Especially, we introduce Sarsa learning to Deep Q Networks for removing overestimations further. Finally, DSQN algorithm is evaluated on cart-pole balancing, mountain car and lunarlander control task from the OpenAI Gym. The empirical evaluation results show that the proposed method leads to reduced overestimations, more stable learning process and improved performance.

AB The rising systems programming language Rust is fast, efficient and memory safe. However, improperly dereferencing raw pointers in Rust causes new safety problems. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis into these problems and propose a practical hybrid approach to detecting unsafe raw pointer dereferencing behaviors. Our approach employs pattern matching to identify functions that can be used to generate illegal multiple mutable references (We define them as thief function) and instruments the dereferencing operation in order to perform dynamic checking at runtime. We implement a tool named UnsafeFencer and has successfully identified 52 thief functions in 28 real-world crates*, of which 13 public functions are verified to generate multiple mutable references.

DE Conceptual data modeling; self checking; artifact-making process; UML
ID DESIGN
AB Conceptual data modeling is an important activity in database design. However, it is difficult for novice learners to master its skills. In the conceptual data modeling, learners are required to detect and correct errors of their artifacts by themselves because modeling tools do not assist these activities. We call such activities self checking, which is also an important process. However, the previous research did not focus on it and/or the data collection of self checks. The data collection of self checks is difficult because self checking is an internal activity and self checks are not usually expressed. Therefore, we developed a method to help learners express their self checks by reflecting on their artifact making processes. In addition, we developed a system, KIfU 3.0, which implements this method. We conducted an evaluation experiment and showed the effectiveness of the method. From the experimental results, we found out that (1) the novice learners conduct self checks during their conceptual data modeling tasks; (2) it is difficult for them to detect errors in their artifacts; (3) they cannot necessarily correct the errors even if they could identify them; and (4) there is no relationship between the numbers of self checks by the learners and the quality of their artifacts.

AB Automatic detection of heart cycle abnormalities in a long duration of ECG data is a crucial technique for diagnosing an early stage of heart diseases. Concretely, Paroxysmal stage of Atrial Fibrillation rhythms (ParAF) must be discriminated from Normal Sinus rhythms (NS). The both of waveforms in ECG data are very similar, and thus it is difficult to completely detect the Paroxysmal stage of Atrial Fibrillation rhythms. Previous studies have tried to solve this issue and some of them achieved the discrimination with a high degree of accuracy. However, the accuracies of them do not reach 100%. In addition, no research has achieved it in a long duration, e.g. 12 hours, of ECG data. In this study, a new mechanism to tackle with these issues is proposed: "Door-to-Door" algorithm is introduced to accurately and quickly detect significant peaks of heart cycle in 12 hours of ECG data and to discriminate obvious ParAF rhythms from NS rhythms. In addition, a quantitative method using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which discriminates unobvious ParAF rhythms from NS rhythms, is investigated. As the result of Door-to-Door algorithm performance evaluation, it was revealed that Door-to-Door algorithm achieves the accuracy of 100% in detecting the significant peaks of heart cycle in 17 NS ECG data. In addition, it was verified that ANN-based method achieves the accuracy of 100% in discriminating the Paroxysmal stage of 15 Atrial Fibrillation data from 17 NS data. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the computational time to perform the proposed mechanism is less than the half of the previous study. From these achievements, it is concluded that the proposed mechanism can practically be used to diagnose early stage of heart diseases.

AB Determining the validity of knowledge triples and filling in the missing entities or relationships in the knowledge graph are the crucial tasks for large-scale knowledge graph completion. So far, the main solutions use machine learning methods to learn the low-dimensional distributed representations of entities and relationships to complete the knowledge graph. Among them, translationmodels obtain excellent performance. However, the proposed translation models do not adequately consider the indirect relationships among entities, affecting the precision of the representation. Based on the long short-term memory neural network and existing translation models, we propose a multiple-module hybrid neural network model called TransP. By modeling the entity paths and their relationship paths, TransP can effectively excavate the indirect relationships among the entities, and thus, improve the quality of knowledge graph completion tasks. Experimental results show that TransP outperforms state-of-the-art models in the entity prediction task, and achieves the comparable performance with previous models in the relationship prediction task.

AB Early reviews, posted on online review sites shortly after products enter the market, are useful for estimating long-term evaluations of those products and making decisions. However, such reviews can be influenced easily by anomalous reviewers, including malicious and fraudulent reviewers, because the number of early reviews is usually small. It is therefore challenging to detect anomalous reviewers from early reviews and estimate long-term evaluations by reducing their influences. We find that two characteristics of heterogeneity on actual review sites such as Amazon.com cause difficulty in detecting anomalous reviewers from early reviews. We propose ideas for consideration of heterogeneity, and a methodology for computing reviewers' degree of anomaly and estimating long-term evaluations simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations with actual reviews from Amazon.com revealed that our proposed method achieves the best performance in 19 of 20 tests compared to state-of-the-art methodologies.

AB Given two data sets of user preferences and product attributes in addition to a set of query products, the aggregate reverse rank (ARR) query returns top-k users who regard the given query products as the highest aggregate rank than other users. ARR queries are designed to focus on product bundling in marketing. Manufacturers are mostly willing to bundle several products together for the purpose of maximizing benefits or inventory liquidation. This naturally leads to an increase in data on users and products. Thus, the problem of efficiently processing ARR queries become a big issue. In this paper, we reveal two limitations of the state-of-the-art solution to ARR query; that is, (a) It has poor efficiency when the distribution of the query set is dispersive. (b) It has to process a large portion user data. To address these limitations, we develop a cluster-and-process method and a sophisticated indexing strategy. From the theoretical analysis of the results and experimental comparisons, we conclude that our proposals have superior performance.

AB We develop a technique for representing variable names and name binding which is a mechanism of associating a name with an entity in many formal systems including logic, programming languages and mathematics. The idea is to use a general form of graph links (or edges) called hyperlinks to represent variables, graph nodes as constructors of the formal systems, and a graph type called hlground to define substitutions. Our technique is based on simple notions of graph theory in which graph types ensure correct substitutions and keep bound variables distinct. We encode strong reduction of the untyped lambda-calculus to introduce our technique. Then we encode a more complex formal system called System F-<:, a polymorphic lambda-calculus with subtyping that has been one of important theoretical foundations of functional programming languages. The advantage of our technique is that the representation of terms, definition of substitutions, and implementation of formal systems are all straightforward. We formalized the graph type hlground, proved that it ensures correct substitutions in the lambda-calculus, and implemented hlground in HyperLMNtal, a modeling language based on hypergraph rewriting. Experiments were conducted to test this technique. By this technique, one can implement formal systems simply by following the steps of their definitions as described in papers.

AB This paper proposes an iterative scheme between human action classification and pose estimation in still images. Initial action classification is achieved only by global image features that consist of the responses of various object filters. The classification likelihood of each action weights human poses estimated by the pose models of multiple sub-action classes. Such fine-grained action-specific pose models allow us to robustly identify the pose of a target person under the assumption that similar poses are observed in each action. From the estimated pose, pose features are extracted and used with global image features for action re-classification. This iterative scheme can mutually improve action classification and pose estimation. Experimental results with a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both for action classification and pose estimation.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB A component-oriented FPGA design platform is proposed for robot system integration. FPGAs are known to be a power-efficient hardware platform, but the development cost of FPGA-based systems is currently too high to integrate them into robot systems. To solve this problem, we propose an FPGA component that allows FPGA devices to be easily integrated into robot systems based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS-compliant FPGA components offer a seamless interface between the FPGA hardware and software running on the CPU. Two experiments were conducted using the proposed components. For the first experiment, the results show that the execution time of an FPGA component for image processing was 1.7 times faster than that of the original software-based component and was 2.51 times more power efficient than an ordinary PC processor, despite substantial communication overhead. The second experiment showed that an FPGA component for sensor fusion was able to process multiple sensor inputs efficiently and with very low latency via parallel processing.

AB This paper addresses the task of assigning labels of fine-grained named entity (NE) types to Wikipedia articles. Information of NE types are useful when extracting knowledge of NEs from natural language text. It is common to apply an approach based on supervised machine learning to named entity classification. However, in a setting of classifying into fine-grained types, one big challenge is how to alleviate the data sparseness problem since one may obtain far fewer instances for each fine-grained types. To address this problem, we propose two methods. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, in which NE type classifiers are all jointly trained with a neural network. The neural network has a hidden layer, where we expect that effective combinations of input features are learned across different NE types. Second, we propose to extend the input feature set by exploiting the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia. While most of previous studies are focusing on engineering features from the articles' contents, we observe that the information of the contexts the article is mentioned can also be a useful clue for NE type classification. Concretely, we propose to learn article vectors (i.e. entity embeddings) from Wikipedia's hyperlink structure using a Skip-gram model. Then we incorporate the learned article vectors into the input feature set for NE type classification. To conduct large-scale practical experiments, we created a new dataset containing over 22,000 manually labeled articles. With the dataset, we empirically show that both of our ideas gained their own statistically significant improvement separately in classification accuracy. Moreover, we show that our proposed methods are particularly effective in labeling infrequent NE types. We've made the learned article vectors publicly available. The labeled dataset is available if one contacts the authors.

TI Fisheye Map Using Stroke-Based Generalization for Web Map Services
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE fisheye view; web map service; stroke
AB A fisheye map lets users view both detailed and wide areas. The Focus+Glue+Context map is a fisheye map suited for Web map systems; it consists of a detailed map (i.e., Focus), wide-area map (i.e., Context), and an area to absorb the difference in scales between Focus and Context (i.e., Glue). Because Glue is compressed, the road density is too high to draw all of the roads in this area. Although existing methods can filter roads to draw, they have problems with rendering the road density and connectivity in Glue. This paper proposes an improved method to filter roads in Glue by applying a generalization method based on weighted strokes. In addition, a technique to speed up the proposed method by using a weighted stroke database is described. A prototype Web map system with a high level of response was developed and evaluated in terms of its connectivity, road density, and response.

DE linked data; semantic classification; wordnet
AB Linked data sets are created using semantic Web technologies and they are usually big and the number of such datasets is growing. The query execution is therefore costly, and knowing the content of data in such datasets should help in targeted querying. Our aim in this paper is to classify linked data sets by their knowledge content. Earlier projects such as LOD Cloud, LODStats, and SPARQLES analyze linked data sources in terms of content, availability and infrastructure. In these projects, linked data sets are classified and tagged principally using VoID vocabulary and analyzed according to their content, availability and infrastructure. Although all linked data sources listed in these projects appear to be classified or tagged, there are a limited number of studies on automated tagging and classification of newly arriving linked data sets. Here, we focus on automated classification of linked data sets using semantic scoring methods. We have collected the SPARQL endpoints of 1,328 unique linked datasets from Datahub, LOD Cloud, LODStats, SPARQLES, and SpEnD projects. We have then queried textual descriptions of resources in these data sets using their rdfs: comment and rdfs: label property values. We analyzed these texts in a similar manner with document analysis techniques by assuming every SPARQL endpoint as a separate document. In this regard, we have used WordNet semantic relations library combined with an adapted term frequency-inverted document frequency (tfidf) analysis on the words and their semantic neighbours. In WordNet database, we have extracted information about comment/label objects in linked data sources by using hypernym, hyponym, homonym, meronym, region, topic and usage semantic relations. We obtained some significant results on hypernym and topic semantic relations; we can find words that identify data sets and this can be used in automatic classification and tagging of linked data sources. By using these words, we experimented different classifiers with different scoring methods, which results in better classification accuracy results.

TI Triple Prediction from Texts by Using Distributed Representations of
   Words
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE distributed representations of words; knowledge extraction; knowledge
   graph completion
AB Knowledge graphs have been shown to be useful to many tasks in artificial intelligence. Triples of knowledge graphs are traditionally structured by human editors or extracted from semi-structured information; however, editing is expensive, and semi-structured information is not common. On the other hand, most such information is stored as text. Hence, it is necessary to develop a method that can extract knowledge from texts and then construct or populate a knowledge graph; this has been attempted in various ways. Currently, there are two approaches to constructing a knowledge graph. One is open information extraction (Open IE), and the other is knowledge graph embedding; however, neither is without problems. Stanford Open IE, the current best such system, requires labeled sentences as training data, and knowledge graph embedding systems require numerous triples. Recently, distributed representations of words have become a hot topic in the field of natural language processing, since this approach does not require labeled data for training. These require only plain text, but Mikolov showed that it can perform well with the word analogy task, answering questions such as, "a is to b as c is to __?." This can be considered as a knowledge extraction task from a text for finding the missing entity of a triple. However, the accuracy is not sufficiently high when applied in a straightforward manner to relations in knowledge graphs, since the method uses only one triple as a positive example. In this paper, we analyze why distributed representations perform such tasks well; we also propose a new method for extracting knowledge from texts that requires much less annotated data. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves considerable improvement compared with the baseline; in particular, the improvement in HITS@10 was more than doubled for some relations.

AB A number of battery-driven sensor nodes are deployed to operate a wireless sensor network, and many routing protocols have been proposed to reduce energy consumption for data communications in the networks. We have proposed a new routing policy which employs a nearest-neighbor forwarding based on hop progress. Our proposed routing method has a topology parameter named forwarding angle to determine which node to connect with as a next-hop, and is compared with other existing policies to clarify the best topology for energy efficiency. In this paper, we also formulate the energy budget for networks with the routing policy by means of stochastic-geometric analysis on hop-count distributions for random planar networks. The formulation enables us to tell how much energy is required for all nodes in the network to forward sensed data in a pre-deployment phase. Simulation results show that the optimal topology varies according to node density in the network. Direct communication to the sink is superior for a small-sized network, and the multihop routing is more effective as the network becomes sparser. Evaluation results also demonstrate that our energy formulation can well approximate the energy budget, especially for small networks with a small forwarding angle. Discussion on the error with a large forwarding angle is then made with a geographical metric. It is finally clarified that our analytical expressions can obtain the optimal forwarding angle which yields the best energy efficiency for the routing policy when the network is moderately dense.

ID PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS
AB A widely-used query on a graph is a regular path query (RPQ) whose answer is a set of tuples of nodes connected by paths corresponding to a given regular expression. Traditionally, evaluating an RPQ on a large graph takes substantial memory spaces and long response time. Recently, several studies have focused on improving response time for evaluating an RPQ by splitting an original RPQ into smaller subqueries, evaluating them in parallel and combining partial answers. In these works, how to choose split labels in an RPQ is one of key points of the performance of RPQ evaluation, and rare labels of a graph can be used as split labels. However there is still a room for improvement, because a rare label cannot guarantee the minimum evaluation cost all the time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of selecting split labels by estimating evaluation cost of each split subquery with a unit-subquery cost matrix (USCM), which can be obtained from a graph in prior to evaluate an RPQ. USCM presents the evaluation cost of a unit-subquery which is the smallest possible subquery, and we can estimate the evaluation cost of an RPQ by decomposing into a set of unit-subqueries. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms rare label based approaches.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely applied in various fields. IoT data can also be put to cloud, but there are still concerns regarding security and privacy. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is attracted attention in cloud storage as a suitable encryption scheme for confidential data share and transmission. In CP-ABE, the secret key of a user is associated with a set of attributes; when attributes satisfy the access structure, the ciphertext is able to be decrypted. It is necessary that multiple authorities issue and manage secret keys independently. Authorities that generate the secret key can be regarded as managing the attributes of a user in CP-ABE. CP-ABE schemes that have multiple authorities have been proposed. The other hand, it should consider that a user's operation at the terminals is not necessary when a user drop an attribute and key is updated and the design of the communication system is a simple. In this paper, we propose CP-ABE scheme that have multiple key authorities and can revoke attribute immediately with no updating user's secret key for attribute revocation. In addition, the length of ciphertext is fixed. The proposed scheme is IND-CPA secure in DBDH assumption under the standard model. We compare the proposed scheme and the other CP-ABE schemes and show that the proposed scheme is more suitable for cloud storage.

AB We developed a system called DELTA that supports the students' use of backward chaining (BC) to prove the congruence of two triangles. DELTA is designed as an interactive learning environment and supports the use of BC by providing hints and a function to automatically check the proofs inputted by the students. DELTA also has coloring, marking, and highlighting functions to support students' attempts to prove the congruence of two triangles. We evaluated the efficacy of DELTA with 36 students in the second grade of a junior high school in Japan. We found that (1) the mean number of problems, which the experimental group (EG) completely solved, was statistically higher than that of the control group on the post-test; (2) the EG effectively used the BC strategy to solve problems; and (3) the students' attempt to use both the forward chaining strategy and the BC strategy led to solving the problems completely.

ID FORMULATION; LIBRARY
AB Multi-label classification is an appealing and challenging supervised learning problem, where multiple labels, rather than a single label, are associated with an unseen test instance. To remove possible noises in labels and features of high-dimensionality, multi-label dimension reduction has attracted more and more attentions in recent years. The existing methods usually suffer from several problems, such as ignoring label outliers and label correlations. In addition, most of them emphasize on conducting dimension reduction in an unsupervised or supervised way, therefore, unable to utilize the label information or a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the performance. In order to cope with these problems, we propose a novel method termed Robust sEmi-supervised multi-lAbel DimEnsion Reduction, shortly READER. From the viewpoint of empirical risk minimization, READER selects most discriminative features for all the labels in a semi-supervised way. Specifically, the l(2,1)-norm induced loss function and regularization term make READER robust to the outliers in the data points. READER finds a feature subspace so as to keep originally neighbor instances close and embeds labels into a low-dimensional latent space nonlinearly. To optimize the objective function, an efficient algorithm is developed with convergence property. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB Recent acoustic event classification research has focused on training suitable filters to represent acoustic events. However, due to limited availability of target event databases and linearity of conventional filters, there is still room for improving performance. By exploiting the non-linear modeling of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their ability to learn beyond pre-trained environments, this letter proposes a DNN-based feature extraction scheme for the classification of acoustic events. The effectiveness and robustness to noise of the proposed method are demonstrated using a database of indoor surveillance environments.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The Euler number of a binary image is an important topological property for pattern recognition, image analysis, and computer vision. A famous method for computing the Euler number of a binary image is by counting certain patterns of bit-quads in the image, which has been improved by scanning three rows once to process two bit-quads simultaneously. This paper studies the bit-quad-based Euler number computing problem. We show that for a bit-quad-based Euler number computing algorithm, with the increase of the number of bit-quads being processed simultaneously, on the one hand, the average number of pixels to be checked for processing a bit-quad will decrease in theory, and on the other hand, the length of the codes for implementing the algorithm will increase, which will make the algorithm less efficient in practice. Experimental results on various types of images demonstrated that scanning five rows once and processing four bit-quads simultaneously is the optimal tradeoff, and that the optimal bit-quad-based Euler number computing algorithm is more efficient than other Euler number computing algorithms.

AB We propose a feature for action recognition called Trajectory-Set (TS), on top of the improved Dense Trajectory (iDT). The TS feature encodes only trajectories around densely sampled interest points, without any appearance features. Experimental results on the UCF50 action dataset demonstrates that TS is comparable to state-of-the-arts, and outperforms iDT; the accuracy of 95.0%, compared to 91.7% by iDT.

AB The rapid development of information techniques has lead to more and more high-dimensional datasets, making classification more difficult. However, not all of the features are useful for classification, and some of these features may even cause low classification accuracy. Feature selection is a useful technique, which aims to reduce the dimensionality of datasets, for solving classification problems. In this paper, we propose a modified bat algorithm (BA) for feature selection, called MBAFS, using a SVM. Some mechanisms are designed for avoiding the premature convergence. On the one hand, in order to maintain the diversity of bats, they are guided by the combination of a random bat and the global best bat. On the other hand, to enhance the ability of escaping from local optimization, MBAFS employs one mutation mechanism while the algorithm trapped into local optima. Furthermore, the performance of MBAFS was tested on twelve benchmark datasets, and was compared with other BA based algorithms and some well-known BPSO based algorithms. Experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithm outperforms than other methods. Also, the comparison details showed that MBAFS is competitive in terms of computational time.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as a global infrastructure for the Information Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on, existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication technologies by ITU-T. Data may be communicated in low-power and lossy environments, which causes complicated security issues. Furthermore, concerns are raised over access of personally identifiable information pertaining to IoT devices, network and platforms. Security and privacy concerns have been main barriers to implement IoT, which needs to be resolved appropriate security and privacy measures. This paper describes security threats and privacy concerns of IoT, surveys current studies related to IoT and identifies the various requirements and solutions to address these security threats and privacy concerns. In addition, this paper also focuses on major global standardization activities for security and privacy of Internet of Things. Furthermore, future directions and strategies of international standardization for the Internet of Thing's security and privacy issues will be given. This paper provides guidelines to assist in suggesting the development and standardization strategies forward to allow a massive deployment of IoT systems in real world.

TI Relation Extraction with Deep Reinforcement Learning

DT Article
DE relation extraction; deep reinforcement learning; CNN; Tree-LSTM
AB In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied in relation extraction task. The method uses only word embeddings as network input, and can model relations between target named entity pairs. It equally deals with each relation mention, so it cannot effectively extract relations from the corpus with an enormous number of non-relations, which is the main reason why the performance of relation extraction is significantly lower than that of relation classification. This paper designs a deep reinforcement learning framework for relation extraction, which considers relation extraction task as a two-step decision-making game. The method models relation mentions with CNN and Tree-LSTM, which can calculate initial state and transition state for the game respectively. In addition, we can tackle the problem of unbalanced corpus by designing penalty function which can increase the penalties for first-step decision-making errors. Finally, we use Q-Learning algorithm with value function approximation to learn control policy pi for the game. This paper sets up a series of experiments in ACE2005 corpus, which show that the deep reinforcement learning framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance in relation extraction task.

AB As advances in networking technology help to connect industrial control networks with the Internet, the threat from spammers, attackers and criminal enterprises has also grown accordingly. However, traditional Network Intrusion Detection System makes significant use of pattern matching to identify malicious behaviors and have bad performance on detecting zero-day exploits in which a new attack is employed. In this paper, a novel method of anomaly detection in industrial control network is proposed based on RNN-GBRBM feature decoder. The method employ network packets and extract high-quality features from raw features which is selected manually. A modified RNN-RBM is trained using the normal traffic in order to learn feature patterns of the normal network behaviors. Then the test traffic is analyzed against the learned normal feature pattern by using osPCA to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the learned feature pattern. Moreover, we design a semi-supervised incremental updating algorithm in order to improve the performance of the model continuously. Experiments show that our method is more efficient in anomaly detection than other traditional approaches for industrial control network.

AB It inevitably comes out information overload problem with the increasing available data on e-commence websites. Most existing approaches have been proposed to recommend the users personal significant and interesting items on e-commence websites, by estimating unknown rating which the user may rate the unrated item, i.e., rating prediction. However, the existing approaches are unable to perform user prediction and item prediction, since they just treat the ratings as real numbers and learn nothing about the ratings' embeddings in the training process. In this paper, motivated by relation prediction in multi-relational graph, we propose a novel embedding model, namely RPEM, to solve the problem including the tasks of rating prediction, user prediction and item prediction simultaneously for recommendation systems, by learning the latent semantic representation of the users, items and ratings. In addition, we apply the proposed model to cross-domain recommendation, which is able to realize recommendation generation in multiple domains. Empirical comparison on several real datasets validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The data is available at https://github.com/yuzhaour/da.

AB Sorting is an extremely important computation kernel that has been accelerated in a lot of fields such as databases, image processing, and genome analysis. Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.

AB This letter presents a Preferable Mad-y (PMad-y) turn model and Low-cost Adaptive and Fault-tolerant Routing (LAFR) method that use one and two virtual channels along the X and Y dimensions for 2D mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC). Applying PMad-y rules and using the link status of neighbor routers within 2-hops, LAFR can tolerate multiple faulty links and routers in more complicated faulty situations and impose the reliability of network without losing the performance of network. Simulation results show that LAFR achieves better saturation throughput (0.98% on average) than those of other fault-tolerant routing methods and maintains high reliability of more than 99.56% on average. For achieving 100% reliability of network, a Preferable LAFR (PLAFR) is proposed.

AB The quality of codebook is very important in visual image classification. In order to boost the classification performance, a scheme of codebook generation for scene image recognition based on parallel key SIFT analysis (PKSA) is presented in this paper. The method iteratively applies classical k-means clustering algorithm and similarity analysis to evaluate key SIFT descriptors (KSDs) from the input images, and generates the codebook by a relaxed k-means algorithm according to the set of KSDs. With the purpose of evaluating the performance of the PKSA scheme, the image feature vector is calculated by sparse code with Spatial Pyramid Matching (ScSPM) after the codebook is constructed. The PKSA based ScSPM method is tested and compared on three public scene image datasets. The experimental results show the proposed scheme of PKSA can significantly save computational time and enhance categorization rate.

AB Traditional speech enhancement (SE) algorithms usually have fluctuant performance when they deal with different types of noisy speech signals. In this paper, we propose multi-task Bayesian compressive sensing based speech enhancement (MT-BCS-SE) algorithm to achieve not only comparable performance to but also more stable performance than traditional SE algorithms. MT-BCS-SE algorithm utilizes the dependence information among compressive sensing (CS) measurements and the sparsity of speech signals to perform SE. To obtain sufficient sparsity of speech signals, we adopt overcomplete dictionary to transform speech signals into sparse representations. K-SVD algorithm is employed to learn various overcomplete dictionaries. The influence of the overcomplete dictionary on MT-BCS-SE algorithm is evaluated through large numbers of experiments, so that the most suitable dictionary could be adopted by MT-BCS-SE algorithm for obtaining the best performance. Experiments were conducted on well-known NOIZEUS corpus to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In these cases of NOIZEUS corpus, MT-BCS-SE is shown that to be competitive or even superior to traditional SE algorithms, such as optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA), multi-band spectral subtraction (SSMul), and minimum mean square error (MMSE), in terms of signal-noise ratio (SNR), speech enhancement gain (SEG) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and to have better stability than traditional SE algorithms.

AB Purchase behavior prediction is one of the most important issues to promote both e-commerce companies' sales and the consumers' satisfaction. The prediction usually uses features based on the statistics of items. This kind of features can lead to the loss of detailed information of items. While all items are included, a large number of features has the negative impact on the efficiency of learning the predictive model. In this study, we propose to use the most popular items for improving the prediction. Experiments on the real-world dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed method. We also analyze the reason for the performance of the most popular items. In addition, our work also reveals if interactions among most popular items are taken into account, the further significant improvement can be achieved. One possible explanation is that online retailers usually use a variety of sales promotion methods and the interactions can help to predict the purchase behavior.

AB In this paper, we propose a filtering approach based on global motion estimation (GME) and global motion compensation (GMC) for pre-and postprocessing of video codecs. For preprocessing a video codec, group of pictures (GOP), which is a basic unit for GMC, and reference frames are first defined for an input video sequence. Next, GME and GMC are sequentially performed for every frame in each GOP. Finally, a block-based adaptive temporal filter is applied between the GMC frames before video encoding. For postprocessing a video codec at the decoder end, every decoded frame is inversely motion-compensated using the transmitted global motion information. The holes generated during inverse motion compensation can be filled with the reference frames. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides higher Bjontegaard-delta peak signal-to-noise ratios (BD-PSNRs) of 0.63 and 0.57 dB on an average compared with conventional H. 264 and HEVC platforms, respectively.

TI A Replication Protocol Supporting Multiple Consistency Models without
   Single Point of Failure
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE distributed database; data replication; consistency model
AB Many distributed systems use a replication mechanism for reliability and availability. On the other hand, application developers have to consider minimum consistency requirement for each application. Therefore, a replication protocol that supports multiple consistency models is required. Multi-Consistency Data Replication (McRep) is a proxy-based replication protocol and can support multiple consistency models. However, McRep has a potential problem in that a replicator relaying all request and reply messages between clients and replicas can be a performance bottleneck and a Single-Point-of-Failure (SPoF). In this paper, we introduce the multi-consistency support mechanism of McRep to a combined state-machine and deferred-update replication protocol to eliminate the performance bottleneck and SPoF. The state-machine and deferred-update protocols are well-established approaches for fault-tolerant data management systems. But each method can ensure only a specific consistency model. Thus, we adaptively select a replication method from the two replication bases. In our protocol, the functionality of the McRep's replicator is realized by clients and replicas. Each replica has new roles in serialization of all transactions and managing all views of the database, and each client has a new role in managing status of its transactions. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed protocol and compared to McRep. The evaluation results show that the proposed protocol achieved comparable throughput of transactions to McRep. Especially the proposed protocol improved the throughput up to 16% at a read-heavy workload in One-Copy Serializability. Finally, we demonstrated the proposed failover mechanism. As a result, a failure of a leader replica did not affect continuity of the entire replication system unlike McRep.

ID MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS; NEUROPATHY; MELLITUS
AB Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases that cause high blood sugar due to functional problems with the pancreas or metabolism. Diabetic patients have few subjective symptoms and may experience decreased sensation without being aware of it. The commonly performed tests for sensory disorders are qualitative in nature. The authors pay attention to the decline of the sensitivity of tactile sensations, and develop a non-invasive method to detect the level of tactile sensation using a novel micro-vibration actuator that employs shape-memory alloy wires. Previously, we performed a pilot study that applied the device to 15 diabetic patients and confirmed a significant reduction in the tactile sensation in diabetic patients when compared to healthy subjects. In this study, we focus on the asymptomatic development of decreased sensation associated with diabetes mellitus. The objectives are to examine diabetic patients who are unaware of abnormal or decreased sensation using the quantitative tactile sensation measurement device and to determine whether tactile sensation is decreased in patients compared to healthy controls. The finger method is used to measure the Tactile Sensation Threshold (TST) score of the index and middle fingers using the new device and the following three procedures: TST-1, TST-4, and TST-8. TST scores ranged from 1 to 30 were compared between the two groups. The TST scores were significantly higher for the diabetic patients (P < 0.05). The TST scores for the left fingers of diabetic patients and healthy controls were 5.9 +/- 6.2 and 2.7 +/- 2.9 for TST-1, 15.3 +/- 7.0 and 8.7 +/- 6.4 for TST-4, and 19.3 +/- 7.8 and 12.7 +/- 9.1 for TST-8. Our data suggest that the use of the new quantitative tactile sensation measurement device enables the detection of decreased tactile sensation in diabetic patients who are unaware of abnormal or decreased sensation compared to controls.

AB This letter proposes an Index based on Irregular Partition of data identifiers (IIP), to enable clients to quickly access multiple data items on a wireless broadcast channel. IIP improves the access time by reducing the index waiting time when clients access multiple data items, through the use of irregular partitioning of the identifier space of data items. Our performance evaluation shows that with respect to access time, the proposed IIP outperforms the existing index schemes supporting multiple data access.

AB In this paper, we aim to investigate the potential usefulness of machine learning in image quality assessment (IQA). Most previous studies have focused on designing effective image quality metrics (IQMs), and significant advances have been made in the development of IQMs over the last decade. Here, our goal is to improve prediction outcomes of "any" given image quality metric. We call this the "IQM's Outcome Improvement" problem, in order to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing IQA approaches. We propose a method that focuses on the underlying IQM and improves its prediction results by using machine learning techniques. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three different publicly available image databases. Particularly, through both 1) in-database and 2) cross-database validations, the generality and technological feasibility (in real-world applications) of our machine-learning-based algorithm have been evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves prediction outcomes of various existing commonly used IQMs (e.g., MSE, PSNR, SSIM-based IQMs, etc.) in terms of not only prediction accuracy, but also prediction monotonicity.

AB Encoding multiple SIFT descriptors into a single vector is a key technique for efficient object image retrieval. In this paper, we propose an extension of local coordinate system (LCS) for image representation. The previous LCS approaches encode each SIFT descriptor by a single local coordinate, which is not adequate for localizing its position in the descriptor space. Instead, we use multiple local coordinates to represent each descriptor with PCA-based decorrelation. Experiments show that this simple modification can improve retrieval performance significantly.

AB This paper proposes a new quantization framework on activation function of deep neural networks (DNN). We implement fixed-point DNN by quantizing the activations into powers-of-two integers. The costly multiplication operations in using DNN can be replaced with lowcost bit-shifts to massively save computations. Thus, applying DNN-based speech recognition on embedded systems becomes much easier. Experiments show that the proposed method leads to no performance degradation.

DE requirement analysis; natural language processing; clustering
AB In the early phases of the system development process, stakeholders exchange ideas and describe requirements in natural language. Requirements described in natural language tend to be vague and include logical inconsistencies, whereas logical consistency is the key to raising the quality and lowering the cost of system development. Hence, it is important to find logical inconsistencies in the whole requirements at this early stage. In verification and validation of the requirements, there are techniques to derive logical formulas from natural language requirements and evaluate their inconsistencies automatically. Users manually chunk the requirements by paragraphs. However, paragraphs do not always represent logical chunks. There can be only one logical chunk over some paragraphs on the other hand some logical chunks in one paragraph. In this paper, we present a practical approach to detecting logical inconsistencies by clustering technique in natural language requirements. Software requirements specifications ( SRSs) are the target document type. We use k-means clustering to cluster chunks of requirements and develop semantic role labeling rules to derive "conditions" and "actions" as semantic roles from the requirements by using natural language processing. We also construct an abstraction grammar to transform the conditions and actions into logical formulas. By evaluating the logical formulas with input data patterns, we can find logical inconsistencies. We implemented our approach and conducted experiments on three case studies of requirements written in natural English. The results indicate that our approach can find logical inconsistencies.

AB In this paper, we first analyze the discriminative power in the Best Match ( BM) 25 formula and provide its calculation method from the Bayesian point of view. The resulting, derived discriminative power is quite similar to the exponential inverse document frequency ( EIDF) that we have previously proposed [ 1] but retains more preferable theoretical advantages. In our previous paper [ 1], we proposed the EIDF in the framework of the probabilistic information retrieval ( IR) method BM25 to address the instance search task, which is a specific object search for videos using an image query. Although the effectiveness of our EIDF was experimentally demonstrated, we did not consider its theoretical justification and interpretation. We also did not describe the use of region-of-interest ( ROI) information, which is supposed to be input to the instance search system together with the original image query showing the instance. Therefore, here, we justify the EIDF by calculating the discriminative power in the BM25 from the Bayesian viewpoint. We also investigate the effect of the ROI information for improving the instance search accuracy and propose two search methods incorporating the ROI effect into the BM25 video ranking function. We validated the proposed methods through a series of experiments using the TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation instance search task dataset.

AB This paper proposes a blind, inaudible, robust digitalaudio watermarking scheme based on singular-spectrum analysis, which relates to watermarking techniques based on singular value decomposition. We decompose a host signal into its oscillatory components and modify amplitudes of some of those components with respect to a watermark bit and embedding rule. To improve the sound quality of a watermarked signal and still maintain robustness, differential evolution is introduced to find optimal parameters of the proposed scheme. Test results show that, although a trade-off between inaudibility and robustness still persists, the difference in sound quality between the original and the watermarked one is considerably smaller. This improved scheme is robust against many attacks, such as MP3 and MP4 compression, and band-pass filtering. However, there is a drawback, i.e., some music-dependent parameters need to be shared between embedding and extraction processes. To overcome this drawback, we propose a method for automatic parameter estimation. By incorporating the estimation method into the framework, those parameters need not to be shared, and the test results show that it can blindly decode watermark bits with an accuracy of 99.99%. This paper not only proposes a new technique and scheme but also discusses the singular value and its physical interpretation.

DE encountered-type haptics; curvature rendering; flexible end effector
ID DISPLAY; CURVATURE; PERCEPTION
AB An encountered-type haptic interface generates touch sensation only when a user's hand 'encounters" virtual objects. This paper presents an effective encountered-type haptic interface that enables rendering of surfaces with variable curvature. The key idea is to systematically bend a thin elastic plate so as to create a curved surface with desired curvature, which becomes a contacting end effector that follows the user's finger and becomes an interface a user can touch when needed. The pose of the curvature is controlled in a way that it corresponds to the curved surfaces of virtual objects and user's finger position. The idea is realized by attaching two commercial haptic interfaces to both edges of a thin acryl plate and squeezing the plate. This setup allows us to generate a cylindrical object with curvature up to 0.035 mm(-1) and gives 3DOF position control and 1DOF rotational control of the curved surface. Achievable workspace and curvature range are analyzed, and the feasibility and physical performance are demonstrated through a visuo-haptic grabbing scenario. In addition, a psychophysical experiment shows perceptual competence of the proposed system.

AB Transfer learning extracts useful information from the related source domain and leverages it to promote the target learning. The effectiveness of the transfer was affected by the relationship among domains. In this paper, a novel multi-source transfer learning based on multi-similarity was proposed. The method could increase the chance of finding the sources closely related to the target to reduce the "negative transfer" and also import more knowledge from multiple sources for the target learning. The method explored the relationship between the sources and the target by multi-similarity metric. Then, the knowledge of the sources was transferred to the target based on the smoothness assumption, which enforced that the target classifier shares similar decision values with the relevant source classifiers on the unlabeled target samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can more effectively enhance the learning performance.

DE spherical camera model; discrete spherical image; Laplacian operator
AB Laplacian operator is a basic tool for image processing. For an image with regular pixels, the Laplacian operator can be represented as a stencil in which constant weights are arranged spatially to indicate which picture cells they apply to. However, in a discrete spherical image the image pixels are irregular; thus, a stencil with constant weights is not suitable. In this paper a spherical Laplacian operator is derived from Gauss's theorem; which is suitable to images with irregular pixels. The effectiveness of the proposed discrete spherical Laplacian operator is shown by the experimental results.

AB This study focuses on modeling the storytelling performance of the participants in a group conversation. Storytelling performance is one of the fundamental communication techniques for providing information and entertainment effectively to a listener. We present a multimodal analysis of the storytelling performance in a group conversation, as evaluated by external observers. A new multimodal data corpus is collected through this group storytelling task, which includes the participants' performance scores. We extract multimodal ( verbal and nonverbal) features regarding storytellers and listeners from a manual description of spoken dialog and from various nonverbal patterns, including each participant's speaking turn, utterance prosody, head gesture, hand gesture, and head direction. We also extract multimodal co-occurrence features, such as head gestures, and interaction features, such as storyteller utterance overlapped with listener's backchannel. In the experiment, we modeled the relationship between the performance indices and the multimodal features using machine-learning techniques. Experimental results show that the highest accuracy ( R-2) is 0.299 for the total storytelling performance ( sum of indices scores) obtained with a combination of verbal and nonverbal features in a regression task.

DE neuroimaging; spatial regularization; anatomical regularization;

AB Recently, a high dimensional classification framework has been proposed to introduce spatial and anatomical priors in classical single kernel support vector machine optimization scheme, wherein the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) training algorithm is adopted, for brain image analysis. However, to satisfy the optimization conditions required in the single kernel case, it is unreasonably assumed that the spatial regularization parameter is equal to the anatomical one. In this letter, this approach is improved by combining SMO algorithm with multiple kernel learning to avoid that assumption and optimally estimate two parameters. The improvement is comparably demonstrated by experimental results on classification of Alzheimer patients and elderly controls.

DE quantum computer simulator; hardware implementation; register reordering
AB Quantum computer simulators play an important role when we evaluate quantum algorithms. Quantum computation can be regarded as parallel computation in some sense, and thus, it is suitable to implement a simulator on hardware that can process a lot of operations in parallel. In this paper, we propose a hardware quantum computer simulator. The proposed simulator is based on the register reordering method that shifts and swaps registers containing probability amplitudes so that the probability amplitudes of target basis states can be quickly selected. This reduces the number of large multiplexers and improves clock frequency. We implement the simulator on an FPGA. Experiments show that the proposed simulator has scalability in terms of the number of quantum bits, and can simulate quantum algorithms faster than software simulators.

   application authentication; ID-based signature; key-insulated signature
ID IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION
AB Broadcasting and communications networks can be used together to offer hybrid broadcasting services that incorporate a variety of personalized information from communications networks in TV programs. To enable these services, many different applications have to be run on a user terminal, and it is necessary to establish an environment where any service provider can create applications and distribute them to users. The danger is that malicious service providers might distribute applications which may cause user terminals to take undesirable actions. To prevent such applications from being distributed, we propose an application authentication protocol for hybrid broadcasting and communications services. Concretely, we modify a key-insulated signature scheme and apply it to this protocol. In the protocol, a broadcaster distributes a distinct signing key to each service provider that the broadcaster trusts. As a result, users can verify that an application is reliable. If a signed application causes an undesirable action, a broadcaster can revoke the privileges and permissions of the service provider. In addition, the broadcaster can update the signing key. That is, our protocol is secure against leakage of the signing key by the broadcaster and service providers. Moreover, a user terminal uses only one verification key for verifying a signature, so the memory needed for storing the verification key in the user terminal is very small. With our protocol, users can securely receive hybrid services from broadcasting and communications networks.

TI A Light-Weight Rollback Mechanism for Testing Kernel Variants in
   Auto-Tuning
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE auto-tuning; rollback; cache; early termination
AB Automatic performance tuning of a practical application could be time-consuming and sometimes infeasible, because it often needs to evaluate the performances of a large number of code variants to find the best one. In this paper, hence, a light-weight rollback mechanism is proposed to evaluate each of code variants at a low cost. In the proposed mechanism, once one code variant of a target code block is executed, the execution state is rolled back to the previous state of not yet executing the block so as to repeatedly execute only the block to find the best code variant. It also has a feature of terminating a code variant whose execution time is longer than the shortest execution time so far. As a result, it can prevent executing the whole application many times and thus reduces the timing overhead of an auto-tuning process required for finding the best code variant.

TI Dynamic Job Scheduling Method Based on Expected Probability of

AB This paper addresses the problem of job scheduling in volunteer computing (VC) systems where each computation job is replicated and allocated to multiple participants (workers) to remove incorrect results by a votingmechanism. In the job scheduling of VC, the number of workers to complete a job is an important factor for the system performance; however, it cannot be fixed because some of the workers may secede in real VC. This is the problem that existing methods have not considered in the job scheduling. We propose a dynamic job scheduling method which considers the expected probability of completion (EPC) for each job based on the probability of worker's secession. The key idea of the proposed method is to allocate jobs so that EPC is always greater than a specified value (SPC). By setting SPC as a reasonable value, the proposed method enables to complete jobs without excess allocation, which leads to the higher performance of VC systems. We assume in this paper that worker's secession probability follows Weibull-distribution which is known to reflect more practical situation. We derive parameters for the distribution using actual trace data and compare the performance of the proposed and the previous method under the Weibull-distribution model, as well as the previous constant probability model. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method is up to 5 times higher than that of the existing method especially when the time for completing jobs is restricted, while keeping the error rate lower than a required value.

AB Controlling fluid simulation is one of the important research topics in computer graphics. In this paper, we focus on controlling the simulation of cumuliform cloud formation. Using a previously proposed method for controlling cloud simulation the convergence speed is very slow; therefore, it takes a long time before the clouds form the desired shapes. We improved the method and accelerated the convergence by introducing a new mechanism for controlling the amount of water vapor added. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by several examples.

AB Verification of a design with respect to its requirement specification is important to prevent errors before constructing an actual implementation. The existing works focus on verifications where the specifications are described using temporal logics or using the same languages as that used to describe the designs. Our work considers cases where the specifications and the designs are described using different languages. To verify such cases, we propose a framework to check if a design conforms to its specification based on their simulation relation. Specifically, we define the semantics of the specifications and the designs commonly as labelled transition systems (LTSs). We appreciate LTSs since they could interpret information about the system and actions that the system may perform as well as the effect of these actions. Then, we check whether a design conforms to its specification based on the simulation relation of their LTS. In this paper, we present our framework for the verification of reactive systems, and we present the case where the specifications and the designs are described in Event-B and Promela/Spin, respectively. We also present two case studies with the results of several experiments to illustrate the applicability of our framework on practical systems.

AB Once a software product has been released, a large number of software products may be derived from an original single product. Management and maintenance of product variants are important, but those are hardly cared because developers do not make efforts for the further maintainability in the initial phase of software development. However, history of products would be lost in typical cases and developers have only source code of products in the worst case. In this paper, we approximate the evolution history of software products using source code of them. Our key idea is that two successive products are the most similar pair of products in evolution history, and have many similar source files. We did an experiment to compare the analysis result with actual evolution history. The result shows 78% (on average) of edges in the extracted trees are consistent with the actual evolution history of the products.

AB Power-aware distributed file systems for efficient Big Data processing are increasingly moving towards power-proportional designs. However, current data placement methods for such systems have not given careful consideration to the effect of gear-shifting during operations. If the system wants to shift to a higher gear, it must reallocate the updated datasets that were modified in a lower gear when a subset of the nodes was inactive, but without disrupting the servicing of requests from clients. Inefficient gear-shifting that requires a large amount of data reallocation greatly degrades the system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a data placement method known as Accordion, which uses data replication to arrange the data layout comprehensively and provide efficient gear-shifting. Compared with current methods, Accordion reduces the amount of data transferred, which significantly shortens the period required to reallocate the updated data during gear-shifting then able to improve the performance of the systems. The effect of this reduction is larger with higher gears, so Accordion is suitable for smooth gear-shifting in multigear systems. Moreover, the times when the active nodes serve the requests are well distributed, so Accordion is capable of higher scalability than existing methods based on the I/O throughput performance. Accordion does not require any strict constraint on the number of nodes in the system therefore our proposed method is expected to work well in practical environments. Extensive empirical experiments using actual machines with an Accordion prototype based on the Hadoop Distributed File System demonstrated that our proposed method significantly reduced the period required to transfer updated data, i.e., by 66% compared with an existing method.

TI Recommender System Using Implicit Social Information
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE recommender systems; implicit social relationships; item relations;
   probabilistic matrix factorization
AB Social recommendation systems that make use of the user's social information have recently attracted considerable attention. These recommendation approaches partly solve cold-start and data sparsity problems and significantly improve the performance of recommendation systems. The essence of social recommendation methods is to utilize the user's explicit social connections to improve recommendation results. However, this information is not always available in real-world recommender systems. In this paper, a solution to this problem of explicit social information unavailability is proposed. The existing user-item rating matrix is used to compute implicit social information, and then an ISRec (implicit social recommendation algorithm) which integrates this implicit social information and the user-item rating matrix for social recommendation is introduced. Experimental results show that our method performs much better than state-of-the-art approaches; moreover, complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets because it scales linearly with respect to the number of observations in the matrices.

AB This paper describes a novel method to improve the performance of second language speech recognition when the mother tongue of users is known. Considering that second language speech usually includes less fluent pronunciation and more frequent pronunciation mistakes, the authors propose using a reduced phoneme set generated by a phonetic decision tree (PDT)-based top-down sequential splitting method instead of the canonical one of the second language. The authors verify the efficacy of the proposed method using second language speech collected with a translation game type dialogue-based English CALL system. Experiments show that a speech recognizer achieved higher recognition accuracy with the reduced phoneme set than with the canonical phoneme set.

TI An Optimization Approach for Real-Time Headway Control of Railway

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE consensus algorithm; cooperative train control; headway regularity; CBTC
ID TRAIN REGULATION; SYSTEM
AB Headway irregularity not only increases average passenger waiting time but also causes additional energy consumption and more delay time. A real-time headway control model is proposed to maintain headway regularity in railway networks by adjusting the travel time on each segment for each train. The adjustment of travel time is based on a consensus algorithm. In the proposed consensus algorithm, the control law is obtained by solving the Riccati equation. The minimum running time on a segment is also considered. The computation time of the proposed method is analyzed and the analysis results show that it can satisfy the requirement on real-time operation. The proposed model is tested and the consensus trend of headways can be observed through simulation. The simulation results also demonstrate that the average passenger waiting time decreases from 52 to 50 seconds/passenger. Additionally, the delay time is reduced by 6.5% at least and energy consumption can be reduced by 0.1% at most after using the proposed method.

TI Improvement of Interruptibility Estimation during PC Work by Reflecting
   Conversation Status
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE interruptibility; desk work; conversation status; PC operation
AB Frequently interrupting someone who is busy will decrease his or her productivity. To minimize this risk, a number of interruptibility estimation methods based on PC activity such as typing or mouse clicks have been developed. However, these estimation methods do not take account of the effect of conversations in relation to the interruptibility of office workers engaged in intellectual activities such as scientific research. This study proposes an interruptibility estimation method that takes account of the conversation status. Two conversation indices, "In conversation" and "End of conversation" were used in a method that we developed based on our analysis of 50 hours worth of recorded activity. Experiments, using the conversation status as judged by the Wizard-of-OZ method, demonstrated that the estimation accuracy can be improved by the two indices. Furthermore, an automatic conversation status recognition system was developed to replace the Wizard-of-OZ procedure. The results of using it for interruptibility estimation suggest the effectiveness of the automatically recognized conversation status.

AB This paper proposes an efficient two-scan labeling algorithm for binary hexagonal images. Unlike conventional labeling algorithms, which process pixels one by one in the first scan, our algorithm processes pixels two by two. We show that using our algorithm, we can check a smaller number of pixels. Experimental results demonstrated that our method is more efficient than the algorithm extended straightly from the corresponding labeling algorithm for rectangle binary images.

DT Article
DE object segmentation; undirected graph; dynamic programming
AB This paper proposes a novel method to segment the object of a specific class based on a rough detection window (such as Deformable Part Model (DPM) in this paper), which is robust to the positions of the bounding boxes. In our method, the DPM is first used to generate the root and part windows of the object. Then a set of object part candidates are generated by randomly sampling windows around the root window. Furthermore, an undirected graph (the minimum spanning tree) is constructed to describe the spatial relationships between the part windows. Finally, the object is segmented by grouping the part proposals on the undirected graph, which is formulated as an energy function minimization problem. A novel energy function consisting of the data term and the smoothness term is designed to characterize the combination of the part proposals, which is globally minimized by the dynamic programming on a tree. Our experimental results on challenging dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Local descriptors, Local Binary Pattern (I-BP) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) are widely used in various computer applications. They emphasize different aspects of image contents. In this letter, we propose to combine them in sparse coding for categorizing scene images. First, we regularly extract LBP and SIFT features from training images. Then, corresponding to each feature, a visual word codebook is constructed. The obtained LBP and SIFT codebooks are used to create a two-dimensional table, in which each entry corresponds to an LBP visual word and a SIFT visual word. Given an input image. LBP and SIFT features extracted from the same positions of this image are encoded together based on sparse coding. After that, spatial max pooling is adopted to determine the image representation. Obtained image representations are converted into one-dimensional features and classified by utilizing SVM classifiers. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on datasets of Scene Categories 8 and MIT 67 Indoor Scene to evaluate the proposed method. Obtained results demonstrate that combining features in the proposed manner is effective for scene categorization.

AB In this paper, a novel statistical model based on 2-D HMMs for image recognition is proposed. Recently, separable lattice 2-D HMMs (SL2D-HMMs) were proposed to model invariance to size and location deformation. However, their modeling accuracy is still insufficient because of the following two assumptions, which are inherited from 1-D HMMs: i) the stationary statistics within each state and ii) the conditional independent assumption of state output probabilities. To overcome these shortcomings in 1-D HMMs, trajectory HMMs were proposed and successfully applied to speech recognition and speech synthesis. This paper derives 2-D trajectory HMMs by reformulating the likelihood of SL2D-HMMs through the imposition of explicit relationships between static and dynamic features. The proposed model can efficiently capture dependencies between adjacent observations without increasing the number of model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated in face recognition experiments on the XM2VTS database.

AB This paper presents a voice conversion (VC) technique for noisy environments based on a sparse representation of speech. Sparse representation-based VC using Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is employed for noise-added spectral conversion between different speakers. In our previous exemplar-based VC method, source exemplars and target exemplars are extracted from parallel training data, having the same texts uttered by the source and target speakers. The input source signal is represented using the source exemplars and their weights. Then, the converted speech is constructed from the target exemplars and the weights related to the source exemplars. However, this exemplar-based approach needs to hold all training exemplars (frames), and it requires high computation times to obtain the weights of the source exemplars. In this paper, we propose a framework to train the basis matrices of the source and target exemplars so that they have a common weight matrix. By using the basis matrices instead of the exemplars, the VC is performed with lower computation times than with the exemplar-based method. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness (in speaker conversion experiments using noise-added speech data) with that of an exemplar-based method and a conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based method.

AB The relative arrangement, such as relative positions and orientations among objects, can play an important role in expressing the situation such as sports games and race scenes. In this paper, we propose a retargeting method that allows maintaining the relative arrangement. Our proposed retargeting method is based on a warping method which finds an optimal transformation by solving an energy minimization problem. To achieve protection of object arrangement, we introduce an energy that enforces all the objects and the relative positions among these objects to be transformed by the same transformation in the retargeting process. In addition, our method imposes the following three types of conditions in order to obtain more satisfactory results: protection of important regions, avoiding extreme deformation, and cropping with preservation of the balance of visual importance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method maintains the relative arrangement while protecting important regions.

AB This paper reports on the image compression tolerability and high implementability of a novel proposed watermarking method that uses a morphological wavelet transform based on max-plus algebra. This algorithm is suitable for embedded low-power processors in mobile devices. For objective and unified evaluation of the capability of the proposed watermarking algorithm, we focus attention on a Watermarking contest presented by the IHC, which belongs to the IEICE and investigate the image quality and tolerance against JPEG compression attack. During experiments for this contest, six benchmark images processed by the proposed watermarking is done to reduce the file size of original images to 1/10, 1/20, or less, and the error rate of embedding data is reduced to 0%. Thus, the embedded data can be completely extracted. The PSNR value is up to 54.66 dB in these experiments. Furthermore, when the smallest image size is attained 0.49 MB and the PSNR value become about 52 dB, the proposed algorithm maintains very high quality with an error rate of 0%. Additionally, the processing time of the proposed Watermarking can realize about 416.4 and 4.6 times faster than that of DCT and HWT on the ARM processor, respectively. As a result, the proposed watermarking method achieves effective processing capability for mobile processors.

ID ENCRYPTION
AB Outsourcing to a cloud storage brings forth new challenges for the efficient utilization of computing resources as well as simultaneously maintaining privacy and security for the outsourced data. Data deduplication refers to a technique that eliminates redundant data on the storage and the network, and is considered to be one of the most-promising technologies that offers efficient resource utilization in the cloud computing. In terms of data security, however, deduplication obstructs applying encryption on the outsourced data and even causes a side channel through which information can be leaked. Achieving both efficient resource utilization and data security still remains open. This paper addresses this challenging issue and proposes a novel solution that enables data deduplication while also providing the required data security and privacy. We achieve this goal by constructing and utilizing equality predicate encryption schemes which allow to know only equivalence relations between encrypted data. We also utilize a hybrid approach for data deduplication to prevent information leakage due to the side channel. The performance and security analyses indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient to securely manage the outsourced data in the cloud computing.

AB Even with the recent development of new types of social networking services such as microblogs, Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) remains popular for local communities and vertical discussions. These BBS sites have high volume of traffic everyday with user discussions on a variety of topics. Therefore it is difficult for BBS visitors to find the posts that they are interested in from the large amount of discussion threads. We attempt to explore several main characteristics of BBS, including organizational flexibility of BBS texts, high data volume and aging characteristic of BBS topics. Based on these characteristics, we propose a novel method of Online Topic Detection (OTD) on BBS, which mainly includes a representative post selection procedure based on Markov chain model and an efficient topic clustering algorithm with candidate topic set generation based on Aging Theory. Experimental results show that our method improves the performance of OTD in BBS environment in both detection accuracy and time efficiency. In addition, analysis on the aging characteristic of discussion topics shows that the generation and aging of topics on BBS is very fast, so it is wise to introduce candidate topic set generation strategy based on Aging Theory into the topic clustering algorithm.

AB Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) is a promising emerging technology, which can solve the bottlenecks faced by electrical on-chip interconnection. However, the existing proposals of ONoC are mostly built on fixed topologies, which are not flexible enough to support various applications. To make full use of the limited resource and provide a more efficient approach for resource allocation, RONoC (Reconfigurable Optical Network-on-Chip) is proposed in this letter. The topology can be reconfigured to meet the requirement of different applications. An 8x8 nonblocking router is also designed, together with the communication mechanism. The simulation results show that the saturation load of RONoC is 2 times better than mesh, and the energy consumption is 25% lower than mesh.

TI Heuristic Function Negotiation for Markov Decision Process and Its
   Application in UAV Simulation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Markov decision processes; heuristic function; reinforcement learning;

AB The traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods can solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) online, but these learning methods cannot effectively use a priori knowledge to guide the learning process. The exploration of the optimal policy is time-consuming and does not employ the information about specific issues. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes heuristic function negotiation (HFN) as an online learning framework. The HFN framework extends MDPs and introduces heuristic functions. HFN changes the state-action dual layer structure of traditional RL to the triple layer structure, in which multiple heuristic functions can be set to meet the needs required to solve the problem. The HFN framework can use different algorithms to let the functions negotiate to determine the appropriate action, and adjust the impact of each function according to the rewards. The HFN framework introduces domain knowledge by setting heuristic functions and thus speeds up the problem solving of MDPs. Furthermore, user preferences can be reflected in the learning process, which improves the flexibility of RL. The experiments show that, by setting reasonable heuristic functions, the learning results of the HFN framework are more efficient than traditional RL. We also apply HFN to the air combat simulation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which shows that different function settings lead to different combat behaviors.

TI Improvement of Steiner Tree Algorithm: Branch-Based Multi-Cast
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Steiner tree; MPH; BBMC; multicast tree
AB There is a well known Steiner tree algorithm called minimum-cost paths heuristic (MPH), which is used for many multicast network operations and is considered a benchmark for other Steiner tree algorithms. MPH's average case time complexity is O(m(l + n log n)), where in is the number of end nodes, n is the number of nodes, and l is the number of links in the network, because MPH has to run Dijkstra's algorithm as many times as the number of end nodes. The author recently proposed a Steiner tree algorithm called branch-based multi-cast (BBMC), which produces exactly the same multicast tree as MPH in a constant processing time irrespective of the number of multicast end nodes. However, the theoretical result for the average case time complexity of BBMC was expressed as O(log m(l + n log n)) and could not accurately reflect the above experimental result. This paper proves that the average case time complexity of BBMC can be shortened to O(l + n log n), which is independent of the number of end nodes, when there is an upper limit of the node degree, which is the number of links connected to a node. In addition, a new parameter beta is applied to BBMC, so that the multicast tree created by BBMC has less links on it. Even though the tree costs increase due to this parameter, the tree cost increase rates are much smaller than the link decrease rates.

AB Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) is a parallel computing platform that provides both high performance of hardware and high flexibility of software. It is becoming a promising platform for embedded and mobile applications. Since the embedded and mobile devices are usually battery-powered, improving battery lifetime becomes one of the primary design issues in using CGRAs. In this paper, we propose a battery-aware task-mapping method to optimize energy consumption and improve battery lifetime. The proposed method mainly addresses two problems: task partitioning and task scheduling when mapping applications onto CGRA. The task partitioning and scheduling are formulated as a joint optimization problem of minimizing the energy consumption. The nonlinear effects of real battery are taken into account in problem formulation. Using the insights from the problem formulation, we design the task-mapping algorithm. We have used several real-world benchmarks to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show that our method can dramatically lower the energy consumption and prolong the battery-life.

AB Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of a configuration bitstream is essential for the dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This is because erroneous or falsified bitstreams can cause fatal damage to FPGAs. In this paper, we present a high-speed and area-efficient bitstream protection scheme for DPR systems using the Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/ Counter Mode (AES-GCM), which is an authenticated encryption algorithm. Unlike many previous studies, our bitstream protection scheme also provides a mechanism for error recovery and tamper resistance against configuration block deletion, insertion, and disorder. The implementation and evaluation results show that our DPR scheme achieves a higher performance, in terms of speed and area, than previous methods.

AB Morphemes, which are obtained from morphological parsing, and statistical sub-words, which are derived from data-driven splitting, are commonly used as the recognition units for speech recognition of agglutinative languages. In this letter, we propose a discriminative approach to select the splitting result, which is more likely to improve the recognizer's performance, for each distinct word type. An objective function which involves the unigram language model (LM) probability and the count of misrecognized phones on the acoustic training data is defined and minimized. After determining the splitting result for each word in the text corpus, we select the frequent units to build a hybrid vocabulary including morphemes and statistical sub-words. Compared to a statistical sub-word based system, the hybrid system achieves 0.8% letter error rates (LERs) reduction on the test set.

AB Avoiding runway incursions is a significant challenge and a top priority in aviation. Due to all causes of runway incursions belong to human factors, runway incursion prevention systems should remove human from the system operation loop as much as possible. Although current runway incursion prevention systems have made big progress on how to obtain accurate and sufficient information of aircraft/vehicles, they cannot predict and detect runway incursions as early as experienced air traffic controllers by using the same surveillance information, and cannot give explicit instructions and/or suggestions to prevent runway incursions like real air traffic controllers either. In one word, human still plays an important position in current runway incursion prevention systems. In order to remove human factors from the system operation loop as much as possible, this paper proposes a new type of runway incursion prevention system based on logic-based reasoning. The system predicts and detects runway incursions, then gives explicit instructions and/or suggestions to pilots/drivers to avoid runway incursions/collisions. The features of the system include long-range prediction of incidents, explicit instructions and/or suggestions, and flexible model for different policies and airports. To evaluate our system, we built a simulation system, and evaluated our system using both real historical scenarios and conventional fictional scenarios. The evaluation showed that our system is effective at providing earlier prediction of incidents than current systems, giving explicit instructions and/or suggestions for handling the incidents effectively, and customizing for specific policies and airports using flexible model.

AB With the proliferation of smart grids and the construction of various electric IT systems and networks, a next-generation substation automation system (SAS) based on IEC 61850 has been agreed upon as a core element of smart grids. However, research on security vulnerability analysis and quantification for automated substations is still in the preliminary phase. In particular, it is not suitable to apply existing security vulnerability quantification approaches to IEC 61850-based SAS because of its heterogeneous characteristics. In this paper, we propose an EEC 61850-based SAS network modeling and evaluation approach for security vulnerability quantification. The proposed approach uses network-level and device groupings to categorize the characteristic of the SAS. In addition, novel attack scenarios are proposed through a zoning scheme to evaluate the network model. Finally, an MTTC (Mean Time-to-Compromise) scheme is used to verify the proposed network model using a sample attack scenario.

DE multi-label classification; least-squares probabilistic classifier
AB Multi-label classification allows a sample to belong to multiple classes simultaneously, which is often the case in real-world applications such as text categorization and image annotation. In multi-label scenarios, taking into account correlations among multiple labels can boost the classification accuracy. However, this makes classifier training more challenging because handling multiple labels induces a high-dimensional optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a scalable multi-label method based on the least-squares probabilistic classifier. Through experiments, we show the usefulness of our proposed method.

DE finger vein; structural feature; neighbor pattern coding
AB We propose a neighbor pattern coding (NPC) scheme with the aim of exploiting the structural feature fully to improve the performance of finger vein verification. First, one-pixel-wide edge is obtained to represent the direction of the binary vein pattern. Second, based on 8-neighbor pattern analysis, we design a feature-coding strategy to characterize the vein edge. Finally, the edge code flooding operation is defined to characterize all of other vein pixels according to the nearest neighbor principle. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI A Low-Power Packet Memory Architecture with a Latency-Aware Packet
   Mapping Method

AB A packet memory stores packets in internet routers and it requires typically RTT x C for the buffer space, e.g. several G Bytes, where RTT is an average round-trip time of a TCP flow and C is the bandwidth of the router's output link. It is implemented with DRAM parts which are accessed in parallel to achieve required bandwidth. They consume significant power in a router whose scalability is heavily limited by power and heat problems. Previous work shows the packet memory size can be reduced RTTxC/root N where N is the number of long-lived TCP flows. In this paper, we propose a novel packet memory architecture which splits the packet memory into on-chip and off-chip packet memories. We also propose a low-power packet mapping method for this architecture by estimating the latency of packets and mapping packets with small latencies to the on-chip memory. The experimental results show that our proposed architecture and mapping method reduce the dynamic power consumption of the off-chip memory by as much as 94.1% with only 50% of the packet buffer size suggested by the previous work in realistic scenarios.

AB This study investigated the relationship between social skills and facial asymmetry in facial expressions. Three-dimensional facial landmark data of facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) were obtained from Japanese participants (n = 62). Following a facial expression task, each participant completed KiSS-18 (Kikuchi's Scale of Social Skills; Kikuchi, 2007). Using a generalized Procrustes analysis, faces and their mirror-reversed versions were represented as points on a hyperplane. The asymmetry of each individual face was defined as Euclidian distance between the face and its mirror reversed face on this plane. Subtraction of the asymmetry level of a neutral face of each individual from the asymmetry level of a target emotion face was defined as the index of "expression asymmetry" given by a particular emotion. Correlation-coefficients of KiSS-18 scores and expression asymmetry scores were computed for both happy and angry expressions. Significant negative correlations between KiSS-18 scores and expression asymmetries were found for both expressions. Results indicate that the symmetry in facial expressions increases with higher level of social skills.

AB Refinement methods for landmark detection and extraction of articulator-free features for a knowledge-based speech recognition system are described. Sub-band energy difference profiles are used to detect landmarks, with additional parameters used to improve accuracy. For articulator-free feature extraction, duration, relative energy, and silence detection are additionally used to find [continuant] and [strident] features. Vowel, obstruent and sonorant consonant landmarks, and locations of voicing onsets and offsets are detected within a unified framework with 85% accuracy overall. Additionally, 75% and 79% of [continuant] and [strident] features, respectively, are detected from landmarks.

AB Existing large-scale systems suffer from various hardware/software failures, motivating the research of fault-tolerance techniques. Checkpoint-restart techniques are widely applied fault-tolerance approaches, especially in scientific computing systems. However, the overhead of checkpoint largely influences the overall system performance. Recently, the emerging byte-addressable, persistent memory technologies, such as phase change memory (PCM), make it possible to implement checkpointing in arbitrary data granularity. However, the impact of data granularity on the checkpointing cost has not been fully addressed. In this paper, we investigate how data granularity influences the performance of a checkpoint system. Further, we design and implement a high-performance checkpoint system named AG-ckpt. AG-ckpt is a hybrid-granularity incremental checkpointing scheme through: (1) low-cost modified-memory detection and (2) fine-grained memory duplication. Moreover, we also formulize the performance-granularity relationship of checkpointing systems through a mathematical model, and further obtain the optimum solutions. We conduct the experiments through several typical benchmarks to verify the performance gain of our design. Compared to conventional incremental checkpoint, our results show that AG-ckpt can reduce checkpoint data amount up to 50% and provide a speedup of 1.2x-1.3x on checkpoint efficiency.

AB There has recently been much research on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) that uses image features including color, shape, and texture. In CBIR, feature extraction is important because the retrieval result depends on the image feature. Query-by-sketch image retrieval is one of CBIR and query-by-sketch image retrieval is efficient because users simply have to draw a sketch to retrieve the desired images. In this type of retrieval, selecting the optimum feature extraction method is important because the retrieval result depends on the image feature. We have developed a query-by-sketch image retrieval method that uses an edge relation histogram (ERH) as a global and local feature intended for binary line images. This histogram is based on the patterns of distribution of other line pixels centered on each line pixel that have been obtained by global and local processing. ERH, which is a shift- and scale-invariant feature, focuses on the relation among the edge pixels. It is fairly simple to describe rotation- and symmetry-invariant features, and query-by-sketch image retrieval using ERH makes it possible to perform retrievals that are not affected by position, size, rotation, or mirroring. We applied the proposed method to 20,000 images in the Corel Photo Gallery. Experimental results showed that it was an effective means of retrieving images.

AB This study proposes an improvement to the Triangular Inequality Elimination (TIE) algorithm for vector quantization (VQ). The proposed approach uses recursive and intersection (RI) rules to compensate and enhance the TEE algorithm. The recursive rule changes reference codewords dynamically and produces the smallest candidate group. The intersection rule removes redundant codewords from these candidate groups. The RI-TIE approach avoids over-reliance on the continuity of the input signal. This study tests the contribution of the RI rules using the VQ-based, G.729 standard LSP encoder and some classic images. Results show that the RI rules perform excellently in the TIE algorithm.

AB Histopathology is a microscopic anatomical study of body tissues and widely used as a cancer diagnosing method. Generally, pathologists examine the structural deviation of cellular and sub-cellular components to diagnose the malignancy of body tissues. These judgments may often subjective to pathologists' skills and personal experiences. However, computational diagnosis tools may circumvent these limitations and improve the reliability of the diagnosis decisions. This paper proposes a prostate image classification method by extracting textural behavior using multifractal analysis. Fractal geometry is used to describe the complexity of self-similar structures as a non-integer exponent called fractal dimension. Natural complex structures (or images) are not self-similar, thus a single exponent (the fractal dimension) may not be adequate to describe the complexity of such structures. Multifractal analysis technique has been introduced to describe the complexity as a spectrum of fractal dimensions. Based on multifractal computation of digital imaging, we obtain two textural feature descriptors; i) local irregularity: alpha and ii) global regularity: f(alpha). We exploit these multifractal feature descriptors with a texton dictionary based classification model to discriminate cancer/non-cancer tissues of histopathology images of H&E stained prostate biopsy specimens. Moreover, we examine other three feature descriptors; Gabor filter bank, LM filter bank and Haralick features to benchmark the performance of the proposed method. Experiment results indicated that the performance of the proposed multifractal feature descriptor outperforms the other feature descriptors by achieving over 94% of correct classification accuracy.

AB Multicore processor architectures have become ubiquitous in today's computing platforms, especially in parallel computing installations, with their power and cost advantages. While the technology trend continues towards having hundreds of cores on a chip in the foreseeable future, an urgent question posed to system designers as well as application users is whether applications can receive sufficient support on today's operating systems for them to scale to many cores. To this end, people need to understand the strengths and weaknesses on their support on scalability and to identify major bottlenecks limiting the scalability, if any. As open-source operating systems are of particular interests in the research and industry communities, in this paper we choose three operating systems (Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD) to systematically evaluate and compare their scalability by using a set of highly-focused microbenchmarks for broad and detailed understanding their scalability on an AMD 32-core system. We use system profiling tools and analyze kernel source codes to find out the root cause of each observed scalability bottleneck. Our results reveal that there is no single operating system among the three standing out on all system aspects, though some system(s) can prevail on some of the system aspects. For example, Linux outperforms Solaris and FreeBSD significantly for file-descriptor- and process-intensive operations. For applications with intensive sockets creation and deletion operations, Solaris leads FreeBSD, which scales better than Linux. With the help of performance tools and source code instrumentation and analysis, we find that synchronization primitives protecting shared data structures in the kernels are the major bottleneck limiting system scalability.

ID VARIABILITY
AB Software product-line engineering is the successful reuse of technology when applied to component-based software development. The main concept and structure of this technology is developing reusable core assets by applying commonality and variability, and then developing new software reusing these core assets. Recently, the emergence of service-oriented environments, called SOA, has provided flexible reuse environments by reusing pre-developed component structure as service units; this is platform-independent and can integrate into heterogeneous environments. The core asset of an SOA is the service. Therefore, we can increase the reusability of an SOA by combining it with the concept of a product-line. These days, there exists research that combines SOA and product-lines, taking into account reusability. However, current research does not consider the interaction between the provider and consumer in SOA environments. Furthermore, this research tends to focus on more fragmentary aspects of product-line engineering, such as modeling and proposing variability in services. In this paper, we propose a mechanism named 2-Level SOA, including a supporting environment. This proposed mechanism deploys and manages the reusable service. In addition, by reusing and customizing this reusable service, we can develop and generate new services. Our proposed approach provides a structure to maximize the flexibility of SOA, develops services that consider systematic reuse, and constructs service-oriented applications by reusing this pre-developed reusable service. Therefore, our approach can increase both efficiency and productivity when developing service-oriented applications.

AB As business values pursued by today's organizations are abstract concepts, measurement of these values and their achievement is not straightforward. This paper proposes a value achievement measuring and managing framework, which recursively decomposes business values to construct a value hierarchy and then links it with the business process hierarchy. The framework makes it possible to measure value achievement, trace values to processes, and take necessary actions in response to the measured progress in value achievement.

ID DEPENDENCE
AB The Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is a kernel-based statistical independence measure that can be computed very efficiently. However, it requires us to determine the kernel parameters heuristically because no objective model selection method is available. Least-squares mutual information (LSMI) is another statistical independence measure that is based on direct density-ratio estimation. Although LSMI is computationally more expensive than HSIC, LSMI is equipped with cross-validation, and thus the kernel parameter can be determined objectively. In this paper, we show that HSIC can actually be regarded as an approximation to LSMI, which allows us to utilize cross-validation of LSMI for determining kernel parameters in HSIC. Consequently, both computational efficiency and cross-validation can be achieved.

DE frequent pattern; graph sequence; reverse search
AB The mining of frequent subgraphs from labeled graph data has been studied extensively. Furthermore, much attention has recently been paid to frequent pattern mining from graph sequences. A method, called GTRACE, has been proposed to mine frequent patterns from graph sequences under the assumption that changes in graphs are gradual. Although GTRACE mines the frequent patterns efficiently, it still needs substantial computation time to mine the patterns from graph sequences containing large graphs and long sequences. In this paper, we propose a new version of GTRACE that permits efficient mining of frequent patterns based on the principle of a reverse search. The underlying concept of the reverse search is a general scheme for designing efficient algorithms for hard enumeration problems. Our performance study shows that the proposed method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and large graph sequence patterns and is several orders of magnitude faster than the original GTRACE.

TI Thresholding Based on Maximum Weighted Object Correlation for Rail

ID HISTOGRAM
AB Automatic thresholding is an important technique for rail defect detection, but traditional methods are not competent enough to fit the characteristics of this application. This paper proposes the Maximum Weighted Object Correlation (MWOC) thresholding method, fitting the features that rail images are unimodal and defect proportion is small. MWOC selects a threshold by optimizing the product of object correlation and the weight term that expresses the proportion of thresholded defects. Our experimental results demonstrate that MWOC achieves mis-classification error of 0.85%, and outperforms the other well-established thresholding methods, including Otsu, maximum correlation thresholding, maximum entropy thresholding and valley-emphasis method, for the application of rail defect detection.

DE frequent pattern mining; graph sequence; induced subgraph subsequence
AB The mining of a complete set of frequent subgraphs from labeled graph data has been studied extensively. Furthermore, much attention has recently been paid to frequent pattern mining from graph sequences (dynamic graphs or evolving graphs). In this paper, we define a novel subgraph subsequence class called an "induced subgraph subsequence" to enable the efficient mining of a complete set of frequent patterns from graph sequences containing large graphs and long sequences. We also propose an efficient method for mining frequent patterns, called "FRISSs (Frequent Relevant, and Induced Subgraph Subsequences)", from graph sequences. The fundamental performance of the method is evaluated using artificial datasets, and its practicality is confirmed through experiments using a real-world dataset.

TI Broadcast News Story Segmentation Using Conditional Random Fields and
   Multimodal Features
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE story segmentation; conditional random fields
ID SPEECH; PROSODY; TEXT; CUES
AB In this paper, we propose integration of multimodal features using conditional random fields (CRFs) for the segmentation of broadcast news stories. We study story boundary cues from lexical, audio and video modalities, where lexical features consist of lexical similarity, chain strength and overall cohesiveness; acoustic features involve pause duration, pitch, speaker change and audio event type; and visual features contain shot boundaries, anchor faces and news title captions. These features are extracted in a sequence of boundary candidate positions in the broadcast news. A linear-chain CRF is used to detect each candidate as boundary/non-boundary tags based on the multimodal features. Important interlabel relations and contextual feature information are effectively captured by the sequential learning framework of CRFs. Story segmentation experiments show that the CRF approach outperforms other popular classifiers, including decision trees (DTs), Bayesian networks (BNs), naive Bayesian classifiers (NBs), multilayer perception (MLP), support vector machines (SVMs) and maximum entropy (ME) classifiers.

   navigation
AB Users recently find their interests by checking the contents published or mentioned by their immediate neighbors in social networking services. We propose semantics-based link navigation; links guide the active user to potential neighbors who may provide new interests. Our method first creates a graph that has users as nodes and shared interests as links. Then it divides the graph by link pruning to extract practical numbers, that the active user can navigate, of interest-sharing groups, i.e. communities of interests (COIs). It then attaches a different semantic tag to the link to each representative user, which best reflects the interests of COIs that they are included in, and to the link to each immediate neighbor of the active user. It finally calculates link attractiveness by analyzing the semantic tags on links. The active user can select the link to access by checking the semantic tags and link attractiveness. User interests extracted from large scale actual blog-entries are used to confirm the efficiency of our proposal. Results show that navigation based on link attractiveness and representative users allows the user to find new interests much more accurately than is otherwise possible.

AB While the Secure Socket Layer or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) is assumed to provide secure communications over the Internet, many web applications utilize basic or digest authentication of Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) over SSL/TLS. Namely, in the scheme, there are two different authentication schemes in a session. Since they are separated by a layer, these are not convenient for a web application. Moreover, the scheme may also cause problems in establishing secure communication. Then we provide a scheme of authentication binding between SSL/TLS and HTTP without modifying SSL/TLS protocols and its implementation, and we show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

Since the highest ranked images in original retrieval results are not always relevant, a naive PRF based re-ranking approach is not capable of producing a satisfactory result. We employ a two-step approach to address this issue. In step 1, a Pearson's correlation coefficient based similarity update method is used to re-rank the high ranked images. In step 2, after estimating a relevance probability for each of the highest ranked images, a fuzzy SVM ensemble based approach is adopted to re-rank the images. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms two other re-ranking methods.

AB Soft error has become an increasingly significant concern in modern micro-processor design, it is reported that the instruction-level temporal redundancy in out-of-order cores suffers an performance degradation up to 45%. In this work, we propose a fault tolerant architecture with fast error correcting codes (such as the two-dimensional code) based on double execution. Experimental results show that our scheme can gain back IPC loss between 9.1% and 10.2%, with an average around 9.2% compared with the conventional double execution architecture.

AB Previous studies of pattern recognition have shown that classifiers ensemble approaches can lead to better recognition results. In this paper, we apply the voting technique for the CoNLL-2010 shared task on detecting hedge cues and their scope in biomedical texts. Six machine learning-based systems are combined through three different voting schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of classifiers ensemble approaches and compare the performance of three different voting schemes for hedge cue and their scope detection. Experiments on the CoNLL-2010 evaluation data show that our best system achieves an F-score of 87.49% on hedge detection task and 60.87% on scope finding task respectively, which are significantly better than those of the previous systems.

AB Scene-context plays an important role in scene analysis and object recognition. Among various sources of scene-context, we focus on scene-context scale, which means the effective scale of local context to classify an image pixel in a scene. This paper presents random forests' based image categorization using the scene-context scale. The proposed method uses random forests, which are ensembles of randomized decision trees. Since the random forests are extremely fast in both training and testing, it is possible to perform classification, clustering and regression in real time. We train multi-scale texton forests which efficiently provide both a hierarchical clustering into semantic textons and local classification in various scale levels. The scene-context scale can be estimated by the entropy of the leaf node in the multi-scale texton forests. For image categorization, we combine the classified category distributions in each scale and the estimated scene-context scale. We evaluate on the MSRC21 segmentation dataset and find that the use of the scene-context scale improves image categorization performance. Our results have outperformed the state-of-the-art in image categorization accuracy.

AB Change history in project revisions provides helpful information on handling bugs. Existing studies on predicting bugs mainly focus on resulting bug patterns,, not these change patterns. When a code hunk is copied onto several files, the set of original and copied hunks often need to be consistently maintained. We assume that it is a normal state when all of hunks survive or die in a specific revision. When partial change occurs on some duplicated hunks, they are regarded as suspicious hunks. Based on these assumptions, suspicious cases can be predicted and the project's developers can be alerted. In this paper, we propose a practical approach to detect various change smells based on revision history and code hunk tracking. The change smells are suspicious change patterns that can result in potential bugs, such as partial death of hunks, missed refactoring or fix, backward or late change. To detect these change smells, three kinds of hunks - add, delete, and modify - are tracked and analyzed by an automated tool. Several visualized graphs for each type have been suggested to improve the applicability of the proposed technique. We also conducted experiments on large-scale open projects. The case study results show the applicability of the proposed approach.

AB Let T be a tree in which every edge is associated with a real number. The sum of a path in T is the sum of the numbers associated with the edges of the path and its length is the number of the edges in it. For two positive integers L-1 <= L-2 and two real numbers S-1 <= S-2, a path is feasible if its length is between L-1 and L-2 and its sum is between S-1 and S-2. We address the problem: Given a tree T, and four numbers, L-1, L-2, S-1 and S-2, find the longest feasible path of T. We provide an optimal O(n log n) time algorithm for the problem, where n = vertical bar T vertical bar.

ID FRAME-RECOMPRESSION ALGORITHM; VIDEO
AB The excessive memory access required to perform motion compensation when decoding compressed video is one of the main limitations in improving the performance of an H.264/AVC decoder. This paper proposes an H.264/AVC decoder that employs three techniques to reduce external memory access events: efficient distribution of reference frame data, on-chip cache memory, and frame memory recompression. The distribution of reference frame data is optimized to reduce the number of row activations during SDRAM access. The novel cache organization is proposed to simplify tag comparisons and ease the access to consecutive 4x4 blocks. A recompression algorithm is modified to improve compression efficiency by using unused storage space in neighboring blocks as well as the correlation with the neighboring pixels stored in the cache. Experimental results show that the three techniques together reduce external memory access time by an average of 90%, which is 16% better than the improvements achieved by previous work. Efficiency of the frame memory recompression algorithm is improved with a 32x32 cache, resulting in a PSNR improvement of 0.371 dB. The H.264/AVC decoder with the three techniques is fabricated and implemented as an ASIC using 0.18 mu m technology.

AB In nearest neighbor distance ratio (NNDR) matching the fixed distance ratio threshold sometimes results in an insufficient number of inliers or a huge number of outliers, which is not good for robust tracking. In this letter, we propose adjusting the distance ratio threshold based on maximizing the number of inliers while maintaining the ratio of the number of outliers to that of inliers. By applying the proposed method to a model-based camera tracking system, its effectiveness is verified.

DE real-time system; low power design; dynamic voltage scaling; stochastic
   speed scheduling
AB Power-aware scheduling of periodic tasks in real-time systems has been extensively studied to save energy while still meeting the performance requirement. Many previous studies use the probability information of tasks' execution cycles to assist the scheduling. However, most of these approaches adopt heuristic algorithms to cope with realistic CPU models with discrete frequencies and cannot achieve the globally optimal solution. Sometimes they even show worse results than non-stochastic DVS schemes. This paper presents an optimal DVS scheme for frame-based real-time systems under realistic power models in which the processor provides only a limited number of speeds and no assumption is made on power/frequency relation. A suboptimal DVS scheme is also presented in this paper to work out a solution near enough to the optimal one with only polynomial time expense. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can save at most 40% more energy compared with previous ones.

AB We describe a parameter estimation method for a target object in an area that sensors monitor. The parameters to be estimated are the perimeter length, size, and parameter determined by the interior angles of the target object. The estimation method does not use sensor location information, only the binary information on whether each sensor detects the target object. First, the sensing area of each sensor is assumed to be line-segment-shaped, which is a model of an infrared distance measurement sensor. Second, based on the analytical results of assuming line-segment-shaped sensing areas, we developed a unified equation that works with general sensing areas and general target-object shapes to estimate the parameters of the target objects. Numerical examples using computer simulation show that our method yields accurate results.

TI News Bias Analysis Based on Stakeholder Mining

DT Article
DE stakeholder mining; Relationship WordNet; relationship structure; bias
   analysis
AB In this paper, we propose a novel stakeholder mining mechanism for analyzing bias in news articles by comparing descriptions of stakeholders. Our mechanism is based on the presumption that interests often induce bias of news agencies. As we use the term, a "stakeholder" is a participant in an event described in a news article who should have some relationships with other participants in the article. Our approach attempts to elucidate bias of articles from three aspects: stakeholders, interests of stakeholders, and the descriptive polarity of each stakeholder. Mining of stakeholders and their interests is achieved by analysis of sentence structure and the use of RelationshipWordNet, a lexical resource that we developed. For analyzing polarities of stakeholder descriptions, we propose an opinion mining method based on the lexical resource SentiWordNet. As a result of analysis, we construct a relations graph of stakeholders to group stakeholders sharing mutual interests and to represent the interests of stakeholders. We also describe an application system we developed for news comparison based on the mining mechanism. This paper presents some experimental results to validate the proposed methods.

TI Enhanced Distal Radius Segmentation in DXA Using Modified ASM

AB The active shape model (ASM) has been widely adopted by automated bone segmentation approaches for radiographic images. In radiographic images of the distal radius, multiple edges are often observed in the near vicinity of the bone, typically caused by the presence of thin soft tissue. The presence of multiple edges decreases the segmentation accuracy when segmenting the distal radius using ASM. In this paper, we propose an enhanced distal radius segmentation method that makes use of a modified version of ASM, reducing the number of segmentation errors. To mitigate segmentation errors, the proposed method emphasizes the presence of the bone edge and downplays the presence of a soft tissue edge by making use of Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed segmentation method, experiments were performed with 30 distal radius patient images. For the images used, compared to ASM-based segmentation, the proposed method improves the segmentation accuracy with 47.4% (from 0.974 mm to 0.512 mm).

AB The basic requirements of the distributed Web crawling systems are short download time low communication overhead and balanced load which largely depends on the systems Web partition strategies In this paper we propose a DHT based distributed Web crawling system and several DHT based Web partition methods First a new system model based on a DHT method called the Content Addressable Network (CAN) is proposed Second based on this model a network distance based Web partition is implemented to reduce the crawler crawlee network distance in a fully distributed manner Third by utilizing the locality on the link space we propose the concept of link based Web partition to reduce the communi cation overhead of the system This method not only reduces the number of inter links to be exchanged among the crawlers but also reduces the cost of routing on the DHT overlay In order to combine the benefits of the above two Web partition methods we then propose 2 distributed multi objective Web partition methods Finally all the methods we propose in this paper are compared with existing system models in the simulated experiments under different datasets and different system scales In most cases the new methods show their superiority

AB In the arsenal of resources for improving computer memory system performance, predictors have gained an increasing role in the past few years. They enable hiding the latencies when accessing cache or main memory. In our previous work we proposed a DDR SDRAM controller with predictors that not only close the opened DRAM row but also predict the next row to be opened. In this paper we explore the possibilities of trying the same techniques on the latest type of DRAM memory, DDR3 SDRAM, with further improvements of the predictors.

AB This paper presents a method to monitor information of a large-sized multicast group that can follow the group's dynamics in real-time while avoiding feedback implosion by using probabilistic polling. In particular, this paper improves the probabilistic-polling-based approach by deriving a reference mean value as the reference control value for the number of expected feedback from the properties of a binomial estimation model. As a result, our method adaptively changes its estimation parameters depending on the feedback from receivers in order to achieve a fast estimate time with high accuracy, while preventing the possible occurrence of feedback implosion. Our experimental implementation and evaluation on Planet Lab showed that the proposed method effectively controls the number of feedback and accurately estimates the size of a dynamic multicast group.

AB We investigate connected proper interval graphs without vertex labels. We first give the number of connected proper interval graphs of n vertices. Using this result, a simple algorithm that generates a connected proper interval graph uniformly at random up to isomorphism is presented. Finally an enumeration algorithm of connected proper interval graphs is proposed. The algorithm is based on reverse search, and it outputs each connected proper interval graph in O(1) time.

AB This paper presents a novel algorithm for Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier. NN classification is a well-known method of pattern classification having the following properties: * it performs maximum-margin classification and achieves less than twice the ideal Bayesian error, * it does not require knowledge of pattern distributions, kernel functions or base classifiers, and * it can naturally be applied to multiclass classification problems. Among the drawbacks are A) inefficient memory use and B) ineffective pattern classification speed. This paper deals with the problems A and B. In most cases. NN search algorithms, such as k-d tree, are employed as a pattern search engine of the NN classifier. However, NN classification does not always require the NN search. Based on this idea, we propose a novel algorithm named k-d decision tree (KDDT). Since KDDT uses Voronoi-condensed prototypes, it consumes less memory than naive NN classifiers. We have confirmed that KDDT is much faster than NN search-based classifier through a comparative experiment (from 9 to 369 times faster than NN search based classifier). Furthermore, in order to extend applicability of the KDDT algorithm to high-dimensional NN classification, we modified it by incorporating Gabriel editing or RNG editing instead of Voronoi condensing. Through experiments using simulated and real data, we have confirmed the modified KDDT algorithms are superior to the original one.

AB This paper presents Probabilistic Bi-polar Radial Reach Correlation (PrBPRRC), a change detection method that is robust against illumination changes and background movements. Most of the traditional change detection methods are robust against either illumination changes or background movements; BPRRC is one of the illumination-robust change detection methods. We introduce a probabilistic background texture model into BPRRC and add the robustness against background movements including foreground invasions such as moving cars, walking people, swaying trees, and falling snow. We show the superiority of PrBPRRC in the environment with illumination changes and background movements by using three public datasets and one private dataset: ATON Highway data, Karlsruhe traffic sequence data. PETS 2007 data, and Walking-in-a-room data.

ID ENHANCEMENT; STATISTICS
AB In this paper the SNR estimation is performed frame by frame, during the speech activity. For this purpose, the fourth-order moments of the real and imaginary parts of frequency components are extracted, for both the speech and noise, separately. For each noisy frame, the mentioned fourth-order moments are also estimated. Making use of the proposed formulas, the signal-to-noise ratio is estimated in each frequency index of the noisy frame. These formulas also predict the overall signal-to-noise ratio in each noisy frame. What makes our method outstanding compared to conventional approaches is that this method takes into consideration both the speech and noise identically. It estimates the negative SNR almost as well as the positive SNR.

AB In this letter, a statistical uncorrelated near class discriminant (SUNCD) approach is proposed for face recognition The optimal discriminant vector obtained by this approach can differentiate one class and its near classes, i e its nearest neighbor classes, by constructing the specific between-class and within-class scatter matrices and using the Fisher criterion In this manner. SUNCD acquires all discriminant vectors class by class Furthermore. SUNCD makes every discriminant vector satisfy locally statistical uncorrelated constraints by using the corresponding class and part of its most neighboring classes Experiments on the public AR face database demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several representative discriminant methods

AB Fractals are mathematical or natural objects that are made of parts similar to the whole in certain ways. In this paper a software reliability forecasting method of software failure is proposed based on predictability of fractal time series. The empirical failure data (three data sets of Musa's) are used to demonstrate the performance of the reliability prediction. Compared with other methods, our method is effective.

DT Article
DE multiple displays; handheld computer; graphically overlaid desktop;

AB This paper presents an intuitive interaction technique for data exchange between multiple co-located devices. In the proposed system, CrossOverlayDesktop, desktop graphics of the devices are graphically overlaid with each other (i.e., alpha-blended). Users can exchange file data by the usual drag-and-drop manipulation through an overlaid area. The overlaid area is determined by the physical six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) correlation of the devices and thus changes according to users direct movements of the devices. Because familiar operations such is drag-and-drop can be applied to file exchange between multiple devices, seamless, consistent, and thus intuitive multi-user collaboration is realized. Furthermore, dynamic overlay of desktop graphics allows users to intuitively establish communication, identify connected devices, and perform access control. For access control of the data. users can protect their own data by simply dragging them out of the overlaid area, because only the overlaid area becomes a public space. Several proof-of-concept experiments and evaluations were conducted. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed interaction technique.

AB This paper presents new approaches for the estimation of range between the preceding vehicle and the experimental vehicle, estimation of vehicle size and its projective size, and dynamic camera calibration. First, our proposed approaches adopt a camera model to transform coordinates from the ground plane onto the image plane to estimate the relative position between the detected vehicle and the camera. Then, to estimate the actual and projective size of the preceding vehicle, we propose a new estimation method. This method can estimate the range from a preceding vehicle to the camera based on contact points between its tires and the ground and then estimate the actual size of the vehicle according to the positions of its vertexes in the image. Because the projective size of a vehicle varies with respect to its distance to the camera, we also present a simple and rapid method of estimating a vehicle's projective height, which allows a reduction in computational time for size estimation in real-time systems. Errors caused by the application of different camera parameters are also estimated and analyzed in this study. The estimation results are used to determine suitable parameters during camera installation to suppress estimation errors. Finally, to guarantee robustness of the detection system, a new efficient approach to dynamic calibration is presented to obtain accurate camera parameters, even when they are changed by camera vibration owing to on-road driving. Experimental results demonstrate that our approaches can provide accurate and robust estimation results of range and size of target vehicles.

AB Properties of Kripke structures can be expressed by formulas of the modal mu-calculus. Despite its strong expressive power, the validity problem of the modal mu-calculus is decidable, and so are some of its variants enriched by inverse programs, graded modalities, and nominals. In this study, we show that the pre- and post-conditions of transformations of Kripke structures, such as addition/deletion of states and edges, can be expressed using variants of the modal p-calculus. Combined with decision procedures we have developed for those variants, the properties of sequences of transformations on Kripke structures can be deduced. We show that these techniques can be used to verify the properties of pointer-manipulating programs.

DE SSD (Solid-State Disk); NAND flash; North Bridge; DRAM interface
AB We propose a Solid-State Disk (SSD) with a Double Data Rate (DDR) DRAM interface for high-performance PCs. Traditional SSDs simply inherit the interface protocol of Hard Disk Drives (HDD) such as Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) or Serial-ATA (SATA) for maintaining the compatibility. However, SSD itself provides much higher performance than HDD, hence the interface also needs to be enhanced. Unlike the traditional SSDs, the proposed SSD with DDR DRAM interface is placed in the North Bridge which provides two or more DDR DRAM interface ports in high-performance PCs. The novelty of our work is on DQS signaling scheme which allows arbitrary Column Address Strobe (CAS) latency unlike typical DDR DRAM interface scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed SSD maximally outperforms the traditional SSD by 8.7 times in read mode, by 1.5 times in write mode. Also, for synthetic workloads, the proposed scheme shows performance improvement over the conventional architecture by a factor of 1.6 times.

AB In this paper, we propose an effective Web cache admission control algorithm. By selectively admitting objects into the cache, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of disk I/O on a Web cache while maintaining a high hit ratio. The proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts its own admission control parameter, requiring no user-supplied parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

DT Article

   object-based video coding; shape-direction-adaptive DWT (SDA-DWT)
AB In this paper, a new lifting-based shape-direction-adaptive discrete wavelet transform (SDA-DWT) which can be used for arbitrarily shaped segments is proposed. The SDA-DWT contains three major techniques; the lifting-based DWT, the adaptive directional technique, and the concept of object-based compression in MPEG-4. With SDA-DWT, the number of transformed coefficients is equal to the number of pixels in the arbitrarily shaped segment image, and the spatial correlation across sub-bands is well preserved. SDA-DWT also can locally adapt its filtering directions according to the texture orientations to improve eneryg compaction for images containing non-horizontal or non-vertical edge textures. SDA-DWT can be applied to any application that is wavelet based and the lifing technique provides much flexibility for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that, for still object images with rich orientation textures. SDA-DWT outperforms SA-DWT up to 5.88 dB in PSNR under 2.15-bpp (bit/onject pixel) condition, and reduces the bit-budget up tio 14.0%.

AB A neighbor-aided authentication water-marking based on a chaotic system with feedback is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can not only detect malicious manipulations but reveal block substitutions when the VQ attack occurs. An image is partitioned into non-overlapped blocks. The pixels in one block and its neighboring block are combined to produce an authentication watermark based on a chaotic system with feedback, which is sensitive to the initial value. The produced water-mark is embedded into the current block. During detection, the detector extracts the watermark firstly, then generates a reference sequence and compares it with the extracted watermark to authenticate the integrity of the image and locate the tampered regions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method.

DE top view image; homography; calibration
AB We describe a practical and precise calibration method for generating a top view image that is transformed so that a planar object such as the road can be observed from a direction perpendicular to its surface. The geometric relation between the input and output images is described by a 3 x 3 homography matrix. Conventional methods use large planar calibration patterns to achieve precise transformations. The proposed method uses much smaller element patterns that are placed in arbitrary positions within the view of the camera. One of the patterns is used to obtain an initial homography. Then, the information from all of the patterns is used by a non-linear optimization scheme to reach a global optimum homography. The experiment done to evaluate the method showed that the precision of the proposed method is comparable to that of the conventional method where a large calibration pattern is used, making it more practical for automotive applications.

DE statistical machine translation; translation dictionary
AB This paper presents a method to effectively introduce a translation dictionary into phrase-based SMT. Though SMT systems can be built with only a parallel corpus, translation dictionaries are more widely available and have many more entries than parallel corpora. A simple and low-cost method to introduce a translation dictionary is to attach a dictionary entry into a phrase table. This, however, does not work well. Target word order and even whole target sentences are often incorrect. To solve this problem, the proposed method uses high-frequency words in the training corpus. The high-frequency words may already be trained well; in other words, they may appear in the phrase table and therefore be translated with correct word order. Experimental results show the proposed method as far superior to simply attaching dictionary entries into phrase tables.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In this paper, we investigate minimum mean absolute error (mmae) predictors for lossless image coding. In some prediction-based lossless image coding systems, coding performance depends largely on the efficiency of predictors. In this case, minimum mean square error (mmse) predictors are often used. Generally speaking, these predictors have a problem that outliers departing very far from a regression line are conspicuous enough to obscure inliers. That is, in image compression, large prediction errors near edges cause the degradation of the prediction accuracy of flat areas. On the other hand, mmae predictors are less sensitive to edges and provide more accurate prediction for flat areas than mmse predictors. At the same time, the prediction accuracy of edge areas is brought down. However, the entropy of the prediction errors based on mmae predictors is reduced compared with that of mmse predictors because general images mainly consist of flat areas. In this study, we adopt the Laplacian and the Gaussian function models for prediction errors based on mmae and mmse predictors, respectively, and show that mmae predictors outperform conventional mmse-based predictors including weighted mmse predictors in terms of coding performance.

AB Various advantages of cooperative peer-to-peer networks are strongly counterbalanced by the open nature of a distributed, serverless network. In such networks, it is relatively easy for an attacker to launch various attacks such as misrouting, corrupting, or dropping messages as a result of a successful identifier forgery. The impact of an identifier forgery is particularly severe because the whole network can be compromised by attacks such as Sybil or Eclipse. In this paper, we present an identifier authentication mechanism called random visitor, which uses one or more randomly selected peers as delegates of identity proof. Our scheme uses identity-based cryptography and identity ownership proof mechanisms collectively to create multiple, cryptographically protected indirect bindings between two peers, instantly when needed, through the delegates. Because of these bindings, an attacker cannot achieve an identifier forgery related attack against interacting peers without breaking the bindings. Therefore, our mechanism limits the possibility of identifier forgery attacks efficiently by disabling an attacker's ability to break the binding. The design rationale and framework details are presented. A security analysis shows that our scheme is strong enough against identifier related attacks and that the strength increases if there are many peers (more than several thousand) in the network.

AB The optimal alignment of two given biosequences is mathematically optimal, but it may not be a biologically optimal one. To investigate more possible alignments with biological meaning, one can relax the scoring functions to get near-optimal alignments. Though the near optimal alignments increase the possibility of finding the correct alignment, they may confuse the biologists because the size of candidates is large. In this paper, we present the filter scheme for the near-optimal alignments. An easy method for tracing the near-optimal alignments and an algorithm for filtering those alignments are proposed. The time complexity of our algorithm is 0(dmn) in the worst case, where d is the maximum distance between the near-optimal alignments and the optimal alignment, and m and n are the lengths of the input sequences, respectively.

AB In recent decades, there has been a great deal of research into the problem of bilingual speech recognition - to develop a recognizer that can handle inter- and intra-sentential language switching between two languages. This paper presents our recent work on the development of a grammar-constrained, Mandarin-English bilingual Speech Recognition System (MESRS) for real world music retrieval. Two of the main difficult issues in handling the bilingual speech recognition systems for real world applications are tackled in this paper. One is to balance the performance and the complexity of the bilingual speech recognition system; the other is to effectively deal with the matrix language accents in embedded language**. In order to process the intra-sentential language switching and reduce the amount of data required to robustly estimate statistical models, a compact single set of bilingual acoustic models derived by phone set merging and clustering is developed instead of using two separate monolingual models for each language. In our study, a novel Two-pass phone clustering method based on Confusion Matrix (TCM) is presented and compared with the log-likelihood measure method. Experiments testify that TCM can achieve better performance. Since potential system users' native language is Mandarin which is regarded as a matrix language in our application, their pronunciations of English as the embedded language usually contain Mandarin accents. In order to deal with the matrix language accents in embedded language, different non-native adaptation approaches are investigated. Experiments show that model retraining method outperforms the other common adaptation methods such as Maximum A Posteriori (MAP). With the effective incorporation of approaches on phone clustering and non-native adaptation, the Phrase Error Rate (PER) of MESRS for English utterances was reduced by 24.47% relatively compared to the baseline monolingual English system while the PER on Mandarin utterances was comparable to that of the baseline monolingual Mandarin system. The performance for bilingual utterances achieved 22.37% relative PER reduction.

ID MURA
AB Though machine vision systems for automatically detecting visual defects, called mura, have been developed for thin flat transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels, they have not yet reached a level of reliability which can replace human inspectors. To establish an objective criterion for identifying real defects, some index functions for quantifying defect levels based on human perception have been recently researched. However, while these functions have been verified in the laboratory, further consideration is needed in order to apply them to real systems in the field. To begin with, we should correct the distortion occurring through the capturing of panels. Distortion can cause the defect level in the observed image to differ from that in the panel. There are several known methods to restore the observed image in general vision systems. However, TFT-LCD panel images have a unique background degradation composed of background non-uniformity and vignetting effect which cannot easily be restored through traditional methods. Therefore, in this paper we present a new method to correct background degradation of TFT-LCD panel images using principal component analysis (PCA). Experimental results show that our method properly restores the given observed images and the transformed shape of muras closely approaches the original undistorted shape.

TI Design of time-varying reverberators for low memory applications

AB Development of an artificial reverberator for low-memory requirements is an issue of importance in applications such as mobile multimedia devices. One possibility is to use an All-Pass Filter (APF), which is embedded in the feedback loop of the comb filter network. In this paper, we propose a reverberator employing time-varying APFs to increase the reverberation performance. By changing the gain of the APF, we can increase the number of frequency peaks perceptually. Thus, the resulting reverberation sounds much more natural, even with less memory, than the conventional approach. In this paper, we perform theoretical and perceptual analyses of artificial reverberators employing time-varying APF. Through the analyses, we derive the degree of phase variation of the APF that is perceptually acceptable. Based on the analyses, we propose a method of designing artificial reverberators associated with the time-varying APFs. Through subjective tests, it is shown that the proposed method is capable of providing perceptually comparable sound quality to the conventional methods even though it uses less memory.

DE cepstral statistics compensation; pseudo stereo codebooks; linear least

AB This paper proposes several cepstral statistics compensation and normalization algorithms which alleviate the effect of additive noise on cepstral features for speech recognition. The algorithms are simple yet efficient noise reduction techniques that use online-constructed pseudo-stereo codebooks to evaluate the statistics in both clean and noisy environments. The process yields transformations for both clean speech cepstra and noise-corrupted speech cepstra, or for noise-corrupted speech cepstra only, so that the statistics of the transformed speech cepstra are similar for both environments. Experimental results show that these codebook-based algorithms can provide significant performance gains compared to results obtained by using conventional utterance-based normalization approaches. The proposed codebook-based cesptral mean and variance normalization (C-CMVN), linear least squares (LLS) and quadratic least squares (QLS) outperform utterance-based CMVN (U-CMVN) by 26.03%, 22.72% and 27.48%, respectively, in relative word error rate reduction for experiments conducted on Test Set A of the Aurora-2 digit database.

AB Combination of mutually complementary features is necessary to cope with various changes in pattern classification between normal and pathological voices. This paper proposes a method to improve pathological/normal voice classification performance by combining heterogeneous features. Different combinations of auditory-based and higher-order features are investigated. Their performances are measured by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and a classification and regression tree (CART) method. The proposed classification method by using the CART analysis is shown to be an effective method for pathological voice detection, with a 92.7% classification performance rate. This is a noticeable improvement of 54.32% compared to the MFCC-based GMM algorithm in terms of error reduction.

TI Accelerating web content filtering by the early decision algorithm
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE webfiltering; text classification; world wide web; early decision
AB Real-time content analysis is typically a bottleneck in Web filtering. To accelerate the filtering process, this work presents a simple, but effective early decision algorithm that analyzes only part of the Web content. This algorithm can make the filtering decision, either to block or to pass the Web content, as soon as it is confident with a high probability that the content really belongs to a banned or an allowed category. Experiments show the algorithm needs to examine only around one-fourth of the Web content on average, while the accuracy remains fairly good: 89% for the banned content and 93% for the allowed content. This algorithm can complement other Web filtering approaches, such as URL blocking, to filter the Web content with high accuracy and efficiency. Text classification algorithms in other applications can also follow the principle of early decision to accelerate their applications.

ID LINEAR LOGIC
AB We propose a query language based on extended regular expressions. This language extends texts with text-generating macros. These macros make it possible to define languages in a compressed, elegant way. This paper also extends queries with linear implications and additive (classical) conjunctions. To be precise, it allows goals of the form D -circle G and G(1) & G(2) where D is a text or a macro and G is a query. The first goal is solved by adding D to the current text and then solving G. This goal is flexible in controlling the current text dynamically. The second goal is solved by solving both G(1) and G(2) from the current text. This goal is particularly useful for internet search.

AB Ubiquitous computing and the upcoming broadcast-and-communication convergence require networks that provide very complex services. In particular, networks are needed that can service several users or terminals at various times or places with various application-layer functions that can be changed at a high response speed by adding high-speed processing at the network edge. I present a query-transaction acceleration appliance that uses a dynamic reconfigurable processor (DRP) and enables high-speed stateful packet-by-packet self-reconfiguration to achieve that requirement. This appliance processes at high speeds, has flexible application layer functions that are changeable with a high-speed response, and uses direct packet I/O bypassing memory, hierarchical interconnection of processors, and stateful packet-by-packet self-reconfiguration. In addition, the DRP enables the fabrication of a compact and electric-power-saving appliance. I made a prototype and implemented several transport/application layer functions, such as TCP connection control, auto-caching of server files, uploading cache data for server, and selection/insertion/deletion/update of data for a database. In an experimental evaluation in which four kinds of query-transactions were continually executed in order, I found that the appliance achieved four functions changeable at a high response speed (within 1 ms), and a processing speed (2,273 transactions/sec.) 18 times faster than a PC with a 2-GHz processor.

AB This study initiates a systematic evaluation of web search engine performance using queries written in Thai. Statistical testing indicates that there are some significant differences in the performance of search engines. In addition to compare the search performance, an analysis of the returned results is carried out.. The analysis of the returned results shows that the majority of returned results are unique to a particular search engine and each system provides quite different results. This encourages the use of metasearch techniques to combine the search results in order to improve the performance and reliability in finding relevant documents. We examine several metasearch models based on the Borda count and Condorcet voting schemes. We also propose the, use of Evolutionary Programming (EP) to optimize weight vectors used by the voting algorithms. The results show that the use of metasearch approaches produces superior performance compared to any single search engine on Thai queries.

   information security
AB Web services (WS, hereafter) paradigm has attained such a relevance in both the academic and the industry world that the vision of the Internet has evolved from being considered as a mere repository of data to become the underlying infrastructure on which organizations' strategic business operations are being deployed [1]. Security is a key aspect if WS are to be generally accepted and adopted. In fact, over the past years, the most important consortiums of the Internet, like IETF, W3C or OASIS, have produced a huge number of WS-based security standards. Despite this spectacular growth, a development process that facilitates the systematic integration of security into all subprocesses of WS-based software development life-cycle does not exist. Eventually, this process should guide WS-based software developers in the specification of WS-based security requirements, the design of WS-based security architectures, and the deployment of the most suitable WS security standards. In this article, we will briefly present a process of this type, named PWSSec (Process for Web Services Security), and the artifacts used during the elicitation activity, which belongs to the subprocess WSSecReq aimed at producing a WS-based security requirement specification.

AB Traffic markers differentiate among packets from senders based on their service profile in the differentiated service networks. Researchers have previously revealed that the existing marking mechanism causes the unfairness in aggregates. This study presents a new marking algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the fairness of the proposed scheme exceeds that of SRTCM, TRTCM, TSWTCM and ITSWTCM for medium to high network provision levels.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE labeled transition system; pushdown automaton; formal model;
   aspect-oriented programming; AspectJ
AB This paper proposes an event-based transition system called A-LTS. An A-LTS is a simple system consisting of two agents, a basic program and a monitor. The monitor observes the behavior of the basic program and if the behavior matches some pre-defined pattern, then the monitor interrupts the execution of the basic program and possibly triggers the execution of another specific program. An A-LTS models a common feature found in recent software technologies such as Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), history-based access control and active database. We investigate the expressive power of A-LTS and show that it is strictly stronger than finite state machines and strictly weaker than pushdown automata (PDA). This implies that the model checking problem for A-LTS is decidable. It is also shown that the expressive power of A-LTS, linear context-free grammar and deterministic PDA are mutually incomparable. We also discuss the relationship between A-LTS and pointcut/advice in AOR.

AB Manually collecting contexts of a target word and grouping them based on their meanings yields a set of word senses but the task is quite tedious. Towards automated lexicography, this paper proposes a word-sense discrimination method based on two modern techniques; EM algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA). The spherical Gaussian EM algorithm enhanced with PCA for robust initialization is proposed to cluster word senses of a target word automatically. Three variants of the algorithm, namely PCA, sGEM, and PCA-sGEM, are investigated using a gold standard dataset of two polysemous words. The clustering result is evaluated using the measures of purity and entropy as well as a more recent measure called normalized mutual information (NMI). The experimental result indicates that the proposed algorithms gain promising performance with regard to discriminate word senses and the PCA-sGEM outperforrns the other two methods to some extent.

AB We consider a problem for constructing a minimum cost r-edge-connected multigraph in which degree d(v) of each vertex v is an element of V is specified. In this paper, we propose a 3-approximation algorithm for this problem under the assumption that edge cost is metric, r(u, v) is an element of {1, 2} for each u, v is an element of V, and d(v) >= 2 for each v is an element of V. This problem is a generalization of metric TSP. We also propose an approximation algorithm for the digraph version of the problem.

AB In this paper, we propose a method of accelerating test generation for sequential circuits by using the knowledge about the availability of state justification sequences, the bound on the length of state distinguishing sequences, differentiation between valid and invalid states, and the existence of a reset state. We also propose a method of synthesis for testability (SfT) which takes the features of our test generation method into consideration to synthesize sequential circuits from given FSM descriptions. The SfT method guarantees that the test generator will be able to find a state distinguishing sequence. The proposed method extracts the state justification sequence from the FSM produced by the synthesizer to improve the performance of its test generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 100% fault efficiency in relatively short test generation time.

AB Intelligent scissors is an interactive image segmentation algorithm which allows a user to select piece-wise globally optimal contour segment corresponding to a desired object boundary. However, the intelligent scissors is too sensitive to a noise and texture patterns in an image since it utilizes the gradient information concerning the pixel intensities. This paper describes a new intelligent scissors based on the concept of the separability in order to improve the object boundary extraction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed by some experiments for actual images acquired by an ordinary digital camera.

AB This paper presents a robust object tracking method under pose variation and partial occlusion. In practical environment, the appearance of objects is changed dynamically by pose variation or partial occlusion. Therefore, the robustness to them is required for practical applications. However, it is difficult to be robust to various changes by only one tracking model. Therefore, slight robustness to variations and the easiness of model update are required. For this purpose, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of local parts is used. KPCA of local parts is proposed originally for the purpose of pose independent object recognition. Training of this method is performed by using local parts cropped from only one or two object images. This is good property for tracking because only one target image is given in practical applications. In addition, the model (subspace) of this method can be updated easily by solving a eigen value problem. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using the test face sequence captured under pose, partial occlusion, scaling and illumination variations. Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated by the comparison with template matching based tracker. In addition, adaptive update rule using similarity with current subspace is also proposed. Effectiveness of adaptive update rule is shown by experiment.

AB This paper describes a method for the classification of bank-notes. The algorithm has three stages, and classifies bank-notes with very low error rates and at high speeds. To achieve the very low error rates, the result of classification is checked in the final stage by using different features to those used in the first two. High-speed processing is mainly achieved by the hierarchical structure, which leads to low computational costs. In evaluation on 32,850 samples of US bank-notes, with the same number used for training, the algorithm classified all samples precisely with no error sample. We estimate that the worst error rate is 3.1E-9 for the classification statistically.

AB In this letter, we, derive an efficient audio/video synchronization method for video telephony. For synchronization, this method does not require any further RTCP packet processing except for the first one. The derived decision rule is far more compact than the conventional method. This decision rule is incorporated in an actual video telephony system adopting Texas Instruments (TI) OMAP 1510 processor and Qual-comm MSM 5500. The computational requirement was compared with the conventional method and through simulations the superiority,of the proposed method is proved.

DT Article
DE wireless networks; authentication; algorithms
AB This work addresses the critical problem of authentication in mobile ad hoc networks. It includes a new approach based on the Zero-Knowledge cryptographic paradigm where two different security levels are defined. The first level is characterized by the use of an NP-complete graph problem to describe an Access Control Protocol, while the highest level corresponds to a Group Authentication Protocol based oil a hard-on-average graph problem. The main goal of the proposal is to balance security strength and network performance. Therefore, both protocols are scalable and decentralized, and their requirements of communication, storage and computation are limited.

DE speech recognition; hidden Markov models; support vector machines;
   augmented statistical models
AB There has been significant interest in developing new forms of acoustic model, in particular models which allow additional dependencies to be represented than those contained within a standard hidden Markov model (HMM). This paper discusses one such class of models, augmented statistical models. Here, a local exponential approximation is made about some point on a base model. This allows additional dependencies within the data to be modelled than are represented in the base distribution. Augmented models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and HMMs are briefly described. These augmented models are then related to generative kernels, one approach used for allowing support vector machines (SVMs) to be applied to variable length data. The training of augmented statistical models within an SVM, generative kernel, framework is then discussed. This may be viewed as using maximum margin training to estimate statistical models. Augmented Gaussian mixture models are then evaluated using rescoring on a large vocabulary speech recognition task.

AB This letter presents a boundary-active-only (BAO) power reduction technique for cell-network-based region-growing video segmentation. The key approach is in adaptive situation-dependent power switching of each network cell, namely only cells at the boundary of currently grown regions are activated, and all the other cells are kept in low-power stand-by mode. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is experimentally confirmed with CMOS test-chips having small-scale cell networks of up to 41 x 33 cells, where an average of only 1.7% of the cells remains active after application of the proposed approach. About 85% power reduction is thus achievable without sacrificing real-time processing.

DE oblivious transfer verification; zero knowledge; cryptography; same
   message attack
AB The Oblivious Transfer (OT), introduced by Rabin in 1981, has become an important and fundamental cryptography technique. An OT protocol should have two important characteristics: the sender's privacy and the chooser's privacy. The sender is a party who will deliver a secret to the chooser. The chooser is another party who acts as receiver to learn some information about the input from the sender. The chooser learns of certain information concerning the sender's input while the sender is not allowed to know what the chooser has learned. Moreover, the chooser cannot acquire any messages that he/she did not choose. Naor and Pinkas have recently proposed an efficient oblivious transfer protocol (EOT) that implementes 1-out-of-n protocol, but this EOT has a flaw: it cannot withstand "the same message attack." In this paper, we will improve Naor and Pinkas EOT and make it resistant to "the same message attack."

AB This paper presents a new technique for automatically synthesizing human walking motion. In the technique, a set of fundamental motion units called motion primitives is defined and each primitive is modeled statistically from motion capture data using a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM), which is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with explicit state duration probability distributions. The mean parameter for the probability distribution function of HSMM is assumed to be given by a function of factors that control the walking pace and stride length, and a training algorithm, called factor adaptive training, is derived based on the EM algorithm. A parameter generation algorithm from motion primitive HSMMs with given control factors is also described. Experimental results for generating walking motion are presented when the walking pace and stride length are changed. The results show that the proposing technique can generate smooth and realistic motion, which are not included in the motion capture data, without the need for smoothing or interpolation.

AB Although the Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems have been rapidly developed to protect copyrights, they have not considered user privacy because they regard this as an unnecessary element in achieving their goals. However, the protection of user privacy becomes one of the most important issues in DRM systems as the number of people who suffer from accidents caused by the infringement of individual information dramatically increases. This paper suggests a license management protocol which is a more powerful protocol to protect individual information in DRM. To protect the exposure of information of user identification, the proposed protocol uses alias like a TID and a token instead of the identity of content users. Due to using alias, this protocol can guarantee the anonymity of content users. Also, it can prevent the leakage of individual information through encryption of usage information. In this way, it can protect the privacy of content users.

AB This paper proposes a novel boundary scan test scheme for intellectual property (IP) core identification via watermarking. The core concept is embedding a watermark identification circuit (WIC) and a test circuit into the IP core at the behavior design level. The procedure depends on current IP-based design flow. This scheme can detect the identification of the IP provider without the need to examine the microphotograph after the chip has been manufactured and packaged. This scheme can successfully survive synthesis, placement, and routing and identify the IP core at various design levels. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach has the potential to solve the IP identification problem.

ID DECODER; DESIGN
AB This paper proposes a reconfigurable adaptive FEC system based on Reed-Solomon (RS) code with interleaving. In adaptive FEC schemes, error correction capability t is changed dynamically according to the communication channel condition. For given error correction capability t, we can implement an optimal RS decoder composed of minimum hardware units for each t. If the hardware units of the RS decoder can be reduced for any given error correction capability t, we can embed as large deinterleaver as possible into the RS decoder for each.t. Reconfiguring the RS decoder embedded with the expanded deinterleaver dynamically for each error correction capability t allows us to decode larger interleaved codes which are more robust error correction codes to burst errors. In a reliable transport protocol, experimental results show that our system achieves up to 65% lower packet error rate and 5.9% higher data transmission throughput compared to the adaptive FEC scheme on a conventional fixed hardware system. In an unreliable transport protocol, our system achieves up to 76% better bit error performance with higher code rate compared to the adaptive FEC scheme on a conventional fixed hardware system.

AB A complete system for the implementation of digital logic in a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform is introduced. The novel power-efficient FPGA architecture was designed and simulated in STM 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The detailed design and circuit characteristics of the Configurable Logic Block, the interconnection network, the switch box and the connection box were determined and evaluated in terms of energy, delay and area. A number of circuit-level low-power techniques were employed because power consumption was the primary concern. Additionally, a complete tool framework for the implementation of digital logic circuits in FPGA platforms is introduced. Having as input VHDL description of an application, the framework derives the reconfiguration bitstream of FPGA. The framework consists of: i) non-modified academic tools, ii) modified academic tools and iii) new tools. Furthermore, the framework can support a variety of FPGA architectures. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing academic and commercial architectures and tools are provided, yielding promising results.

DE object-oriented system; component; metrics; reengineering
AB The increasing complexity and shorter life cycle of software have made it necessary to reuse software. Object-oriented development has not facilitated extensive reuse of software and it has become difficult to manage and understand modern object-oriented systems which have become very extensive and complex. However, components, compared with objects, provide more advanced means of structuring, describing and developing systems, because they are more coarse grained and have more domain-specific aspects than objects. In addition, they are also suited to a current distributed environment due to their reusability, maintainability and granularity. In this paper, we present a process of extracting components from object-oriented systems. We define some static metrics and guidelines that can be applied to transform object-oriented systems into component-based systems. Our process consists of two parts. First, basic components are created based on composition and inheritance relationships between classes. Second, the intermediate system is refined into a component-based system with our proposed static metrics and guidelines.

AB We formally define the mobile agent allocation problem from a system-wide viewpoint and then prove that it is strongly NP-complete even if each agent communicates only with two agents. This is the first formal definition for scheduling mobile agents from the viewpoint of load balancing, which enables us to discuss its properties on a rigorous basis. The problem is recognized as preemptive scheduling with independent tasks that require mutual communication. The result implies that almost all subproblems of mobile agent allocation, which require mutual communication of agents, are strongly NP-complete.

DE software resting; selective testing; prioritization
ID RELIABILITY
AB In order to respond to the active market's needs for software with various new functions, the system testing must be completed within a limited period. Additionally, important faults, which are closely related to essential functions for users or the target system, have to be removed, preferably in system testing. Many techniques have been proposed to date for effective software testing. Among them, selective software testing is one of the most cost effective techniques. However, most of the previous techniques cannot be applied to short-term development and initial development of software with various new functions because much cost is needed for their testing preparation. In this paper, we propose a new method for selective system testing in which priorities assigned to functions play an essential role in the execution of testing. The priorities are determined based on the evaluation results of three metrics for functions: the frequency of use, the complexity of use scenario, and the fault impact to users. Detailed testing instructions are assigned to test items with high priority, and short and ordinal instructions are assigned to those with low priority. The difference in the volume of testing instruction controls the effort of checking test items. As a result of experimental application to actual software testing in a certain company, we have confirmed that the proposed selective system testing can detect both fatal faults related to key functions and critical faults for the system.

TI TAJODA: Proposed tactile and jog dial interface for the blind
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE accessibility; speech interfaces; tactile intetfaces; blind usability
AB There is a fatal difference in obtaining information between sighted people and the blind. Screen reading technology assists blind people in accessing digital documents by themselves helping to bridge such gap. However. these days they are becoming much more visual using various types of visual effects for sighted people to explore the information intuitively at a glance. It is very hard to convey visual effects non-visually and intuitively while retaining the original effects. In addition, it takes a long time to explore the information, since blind people use the keyboard for exploration. while sighted people use eye movement. This research aims at improving the non-visual exploration interface and improving the quality of non-visual information. Therefore, TAJODA (tactile jog dial interface) was proposed to solve these problems. It presents verbal information (text information) in the form of speech. while nonverbal information (visual effects) is represented in the form of tactile sensations. It uses a jog dial as an exploration device. which makes it possible to explore forward or backward intuitively in the speech information by spinning the jog dial clockwise or counterclockwise. It also integrates a tactile device to represent visual effects non-visually. Both speech and tactile information can be synchronized with the dial movements. The speed of spinning the dial affects the speech rate. The main part of this paper describes an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed TAJODA interface. The experimental system used a preprocessed recorded human voice as test data. The training sessions showed that it was easy to learn how to use TAJODA. The comparison test session clearly showed that the subjects could perform the comparison task using TAJODA significantly faster (2.4 times faster) than with the comparison method that is closest to the existing screen reading function. Through this experiment, our results showed that TAJODA can drastically improve the non-visual exploration interface.

DE spoken document categorization; subword unit representations; sleeping

AB In this paper, we explore a method to the problem of spoken document categorization, which is the task of automatically assigning spoken documents into a set of predetermined categories. To categorize spoken documents, subword unit representations are used as an alternative to word units generated by either keyword spotting or large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). An advantage of using subword acoustic unit representations to spoken document categorization is that it does not require prior knowledge about the contents of the spoken documents and addresses the out of vocabulary (OOV) problem. Moreover, this method works in reliance on the sounds of speech rather than exact orthography. The use of subword units instead of words allows, approximate matching on inaccurate transcriptions, makes "sounds-like" spoken document categorization possible. We also explore the performance of our method when the training set contains both perfect and errorful phonetic transcriptions, and hope the classifiers can learn from the confusion characteristics of recognizer and pronunciation variants of words to improve the robustness of whole system. Our experiments based on both artificial and real corrupted data sets show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the word based method.

AB In this paper, we investigate how to initialise cellular automata implemented in the hyperbolic plane. We generalise a technique which was indicated in [2] to the case of any rectangular regular grid of the hyperbolic plane. This allows us to construct the initial configuration of any cellular automaton belonging to a rather large class of problems.

ID PARTIAL K-TREES; ALGORITHM
AB A total coloring of a graph G is to color all vertices and edges of G so that no two adjacent or incident elements receive the same color. Let C be a set of colors, and let omega be a cost function which assigns to each color c in C a real number omega(c) as a cost of c. A total coloring f of G is called an optimal total coloring if the sum of costs omega(f(x)) of colors f(x) assigned to all vertices and edges x is as small as possible. In this paper, we give an algorithm to find an optimal total coloring of any tree T in time O(nDelta(3)) where n is the number of vertices in T and Delta is the maximum degree of T.

DT Article
DE measurement tool; one-way packet loss; network tomography
AB The recent evolution on the network tomography have successfully provided principles and methodologies of inferring network-internal (local) characteristics solely from end-to-end measurements, which should be followed by deployment in practical use. In this paper, two kinds of user-oriented tools for inferring one-way packet losses based on the network tomography are proposed. They can infer one-way packet loss rates on paths or path segments from/to a user-host (a client) to/from a specified target host (an application server or a router) without any measurement on the target, and thus can find the congested area along the path between the client and an application server. One is a stand-alone tool running on the client, and the other is a client-server style tool running on both the client and a proxy measurement server distributed in the Internet. Prototypes of the tools have been developed and evaluated by experiments in the actual Internet environment, which shows that the tools can infer the loss rates within 1% errors in various network conditions.

AB In most cases of distributed memory computations, node programs are executed on processors according to the owner computes rule. However, owner computes rule is not best suited for irregular application codes. In irregular application codes, use of indirection in accessing left hand side array makes it difficult to partition the loop iterations, and because of use of indirection in accessing right hand side elements, we may reduce total communication by using heuristics other than owner computes rule. In this paper, we propose a communication cost reduction computes rule for irregular loop partitioning, called least communication computes rule. We partition a loop iteration to a processor on which the minimal communication cost is ensured when executing that iteration. Then, after all iterations are partitioned into various processors, we give global vs. local data transformation rule, indirection arrays remapping and communication optimization methods. The experimental results show that, in most cases, our approaches achieved better performance than other loop partitioning rules.

AB In this paper we present a new, two-centered electronic voting scheme that is capable of preserving privacy, universal verifiability, and robustness. An interesting property of our scheme is the use of double encryption with additive homomorphic encryption functions. In the two-centered scheme, the first center decrypts the ballots, checks the eligibility of the voters, and multiplies each eligible vote, which is still encrypted in the cryptosystem of the second center. After the deadline is reached, the second center obtains the final tally by decrypting the accumulated votes. As such, both centers cannot know the content of any individual vote, as each vote is hidden in the accumulated result, therefore the privacy of the voters is preserved. Our protocols, together with some existing protocols, allow everyone to verify that all valid votes are correctly counted. We apply the r-th residue cryptosystem as the homomorphic encryption function. Although decryption in the r-th residue cryptosystem requires an exhaustive search for all possible values, based on experiments we show that it is possible to achieve desirable performance for large-scale elections.

AB In this paper, our aim is to extract real-time movement-related potentials, especially readiness-potentials, from EEGs with a small number of scalp electrodes. We proposed a method composed of independent component analysis (ICA), dipole tracing (DT) and scalp Laplacian methods. The proposed method shows a good real-time RP extraction capability from a single-trial of movement by means of the selection of EEGs with high reliability based on the DT and the improvement of the spatial resolution of the scalp potentials based on the scalp Laplacian.

AB This paper presents a modified microwave radio-thermometer (MRTM) with material characteristic estimator and multiple temperature conversion tables to measure subcutaneous temperature of a living body. This estimator provides a temperature retrieval unit with material characteristics such as permittivity. conductivity. thickness and geometry of the living body. The temperature retrieval unit with multiple temperature conversion tables can select one of the tables and compute temperature value corresponding to measured radiation power. In the experiments, it was shown that the radio-thermometer could reduce measurement errors of about 0.82 degreesC to 7.68 degreesC for the cases of distilled water and mixed liquid #5 with thickness of 29.5 cm and 9.5 cm at the temperature of 37degreesC.

DE design pattern; formal specification; DPSL; UML; tool
AB Design patterns* can be regarded as an approach to encapsulate and reuse good design practices. However, most design patterns are specified using informal text and examples. To obtain all of the benefits of patterns, formal specification and tool support are indispensable. This paper proposes a Design Pattern Specification Language (DPSL) that is both manageable and effective. The DPSL provides software developers with the capability to treat design patterns as concrete design units without lowering abstraction. To demonstrate the usability of our DPSL and its application in design modeling, we have developed a prototype tool that supports the DPSL in UML diagrams. This prototype allows us to demonstrate the tool's support possibilities and the usability of patterns for software development applications.

ID EM-ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD
AB This paper presents a maximum likelihood (ML) identification and restoration method for noisy blurred images. The unitary discrete sine transform (DST) is employed to decouple the large order spatial state-space representation of the noisy blurred image into a bank of one-dimensional real state-space scalar subsystems. By assuming that the noises are Gaussian distributed processes, the maximum likelihood estimation technique using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to jointly identify the blurring functions, the image model parameters and the noise variances. In order to improve the computational efficiency, the conventional Kalman smoother is incorporated to give the estimates. The identification process also yields the estimates of transformed image data, from which the original image is restored by the inverse DST. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the recently proposed spatial domain DFT-based methods.

AB It is known that all minimum cuts in an edge-weighted undirected graph with n vertices and m edges can be represented by a cactus with O(n) vertices and edges, a connected graph in which each edge is contained in an exactly one cycle. In this paper, we show that such a cactus representation can be computed in O(mn + n(2) log n) time and O(m) space. This improves the previously best complexity of deterministic cactus construction algorithms, and matches with the time bound of the fastest deterministic algorithm for computing a single minimum cut.

AB This paper presents a novel and practical face-assisted video coding scheme to enhance the visual quality of the face region in videophone applications. A low-complexity skin-color-based face detection and tracking scheme is proposed to locate the human face regions in realtime. After classifying the macroblocks (MBs) into the face and non-face regions, we present a dynamic distortion-weighting adjustment (DDWA) scheme to skip encoding the static non-face MBs, and the saved bits are used to compensate the face region by increasing the distortion weighting of the face MBs. The quality of the face regions will thus be largely enhanced. Moreover, the computation originally required for encoding the skipped MBs can also be saved. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the PSNR and the subjective quality of face regions, while the degradation introduced on the non-face areas is relatively invisible to human perception. The proposed algorithm is fully compatible with the H.263 standard, and the low complexity feature makes it well suited to be implemented for real-time applications.

AB Until today, digital image watermarking has not been large-scale used in the industry. The first reason is that the watermarking efficiency is low and the real-time performance cannot be satisfied. The second reason is that the watermarking scheme cannot cope with various attacks. To solve above problems, this paper presents a multi-domain based digital image watermarking scheme, where a fast DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) based watermarking method is proposed for synchronization correction and an IWT-DCT (Integer Wavelet Transform-Discrete Cosine Transform) based watermarking method is proposed for information embedding. The proposed scheme has high efficiency during embedding and extraction. Compared with five existing schemes, the robustness of our scheme is very strong and our scheme can cope with many common attacks and compound attacks, and thus can be used in wide application scenarios.

TI Local-to-Global Structure-Aware Transformer for Question Answering over
   Structured Knowledge
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE knowledge representation; pretrained transformer; knowledge base
   question answering; table fact verification
AB Question-answering tasks over structured knowledge (i.e., tables and graphs) require the ability to encode structural information. Tra-ditional pre-trained language models trained on linear-chain natural lan-guage cannot be directly applied to encode tables and graphs. The existing methods adopt the pre-trained models in such tasks by flattening structured knowledge into sequences. However, the serialization operation will lead to the loss of the structural information of knowledge. To better employ pre -trained transformers for structured knowledge representation, we propose a novel structure-aware transformer (SATrans) that injects the local-to-global structural information of the knowledge into the mask of the different self -attention layers. Specifically, in the lower self-attention layers, SATrans fo-cus on the local structural information of each knowledge token to learn a more robust representation of it. In the upper self-attention layers, SATrans further injects the global information of the structured knowledge to inte-grate the information among knowledge tokens. In this way, the SATrans can effectively learn the semantic representation and structural information from the knowledge sequence and the attention mask, respectively. We evaluate SATrans on the table fact verification task and the knowledge base question-answering task. Furthermore, we explore two methods to com-bine symbolic and linguistic reasoning for these tasks to solve the problem that the pre-trained models lack symbolic reasoning ability. The experiment results reveal that the methods consistently outperform strong baselines on the two benchmarks.

AB With a rapidly escalating number of sophisticated cyberattacks, protecting Internet of Things (IoT) networks against unauthorized activity is a major concern. The detection of malicious attack traffic is thus crucial for IoT security to prevent unwanted traffic. However, existing traditional malicious traffic detection systems which relied on supervised machine learning approach need a considerable number of benign and malware traffic samples to train the machine learning models. Moreover, in the cases of zero-day attacks, only a few labeled traffic samples are accessible for analysis. To deal with this, we propose a few-shot malicious IoT traffic detection system with a prototypical graph neural network. The proposed approach does not require prior knowledge of network payload binaries or network traffic signatures. The model is trained on labeled traffic data and tested to evaluate its ability to detect new types of attacks when only a few labeled traffic samples are available. The proposed detection system first categorizes the network traffic as a bidirectional flow and visualizes the binary traffic flow as a color image. A neural network is then applied to the visualized traffic to extract important features. After that, using the proposed few-shot graph neural network approach, the model is trained on different few-shot tasks to generalize it to new unseen attacks. The proposed model is evaluated on a network traffic dataset consisting of benign traffic and traffic corresponding to six types of attacks. The results revealed that our proposed model achieved an F1 score of 0.91 and 0.94 in 5-shot and 10-shot classification, respectively, and outperformed the baseline models.

AB The commonly used object detection algorithm based on convolutional neural network is difficult to meet the real-time requirement on embedded platform due to its large size of model, large amount of cal-culation, and long inference time. It is necessary to use model compression to reduce the amount of network calculation and increase the speed of net-work inference. This paper conducts compression of vehicle and pedestrian detection network by pruning and removing redundant parameters. The ve-hicle and pedestrian detection network is trained based on YOLOv3 model by using K-means++ to cluster the anchor boxes. The detection accuracy is improved by changing the proportion of categorical losses and regres-sion losses for each category in the loss function because of the unbalanced number of targets in the dataset. A layer and channel pruning algorithm is proposed by combining global channel pruning thresholds and L1 norm, which can reduce the time cost of the network layer transfer process and the amount of computation. Network layer fusion based on TensorRT is performed and inference is performed using half-precision floating-point to improve the speed of inference. Results show that the vehicle and pedes-trian detection compression network pruned 84% channels and 15 Shortcut modules can reduce the size by 32% and the amount of calculation by 17%. While the network inference time can be decreased to 21 ms, which is 1.48 times faster than the network pruned 84% channels.

   attention visualization
AB Fine-grained image classification is one of the key basic tasks of computer vision. The appearance of traditional deep convolu-tional neural network (DCNN) combined with attention mechanism can focus on partial and local features of fine-grained images, but it still lacks the consideration of the embedding mode of different attention modules in the network, leading to the unsatisfactory result of classification model. To solve the above problems, three different attention mechanisms are in-troduced into the DCNN network (like ResNet, VGGNet, etc.), including SE, CBAM and ECA modules, so that DCNN could better focus on the key local features of salient regions in the image. At the same time, we adopt three different embedding modes of attention modules, including se-rial, residual and parallel modes, to further improve the performance of the classification model. The experimental results show that the three attention modules combined with three different embedding modes can improve the performance of DCNN network effectively. Moreover, compared with SE and ECA, CBAM has stronger feature extraction capability. Among them, the parallelly embedded CBAM can make the local information paid atten-tion to by DCNN richer and more accurate, and bring the optimal effect for DCNN, which is 1.98% and 1.57% higher than that of original VGG16 and Resnet34 in CUB-200-2011 dataset, respectively. The visualization anal-ysis also indicates that the attention modules can be easily embedded into DCNN networks, especially in the parallel mode, with stronger generality and universality.

AB This paper analyzes a blockchain network forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG), called a DAG-type blockchain, from the view-point of graph algorithm theory. To use a DAG-type blockchain, NP-hard graph optimization problems on the DAG are required to be solved. Although various problems for undirected and directed graphs can be efficiently solved by using the notions of graph parameters, these currently known parameters are meaningless for DAGs, which implies that it is hopeless to design efficient algorithms based on the parameters for such problems. In this work, we propose a novel graph parameter for directed graphs called a DAG-pathwidth, which represents the closeness to a directed path. This is an extension of the pathwidth, a well-known graph parameter for undirected graphs. We analyze the features of the DAG-pathwidth and prove that computing the DAG-pathwidth of a DAG (directed graph in general) is NP-complete. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm for a variant of the maximum k-independent set problem for the DAG-type blockchain when the DAG-pathwidth of the input graph is small.

AB We characterized prion disease by comparing brain functional connectivity network (BFCN), which were constructed by 16-ch scalp-recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs). The connectivity between each pair of nodes (electrodes) were computed by synchronization likelihood (SL). The BFCN was applied to graph theory to discriminate prion disease patients from healthy elderlies and dementia groups.

AB A new method for hiding information in digital images is proposed. Our method differs from existing techniques in that the in-formation is hidden in a mixture of colors carefully tuned on a specific device according to the device's signal-to-luminance (gamma) character-istics. Because these reproduction characteristics differ in general from device to device and even from model to model, the hidden information ap-pears when the cover image is viewed on a different device, and hence the hiding property is device-dependent. To realize this, we modulated a cover image using two identically-looking checkerboard patterns and switched them locally depending on the hidden information. Reproducing these two patterns equally on a different device is difficult. A possible application of our method would be secure printing where an image is allowed to be viewed only on a screen but a warning message appears when it is printed.

AB With the continued innovation of deep neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) that more closely resemble biological brain synapses have attracted attention because of their low power con-sumption. Unlike artificial neural networks (ANNs), for continuous data values, they must employ an encoding process to convert the values to spike trains, suppressing the SNN's performance. To avoid this degrada-tion, the incoming analog signal must be regulated prior to the encoding process, which is also realized in living things e.g., the basement mem-branes of humans mechanically perform the Fourier transform. To this end, we combine an ANN and an SNN to build ANN-to-SNN hybrid neu-ral networks (HNNs) that improve the concerned performance. To qualify this performance and robustness, MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets are used for various classification tasks in which the training and encod-ing methods changes. In addition, we present simultaneous and separate training methods for the artificial and spiking layers, considering the en-coding methods of each. We find that increasing the number of artificial layers at the expense of spiking layers improves the HNN performance. For straightforward datasets such as MNIST, similar performances as ANN's are achieved by using duplicate coding and separate learning. However, for more complex tasks, the use of Gaussian coding and simultaneous learning is found to improve the accuracy of the HNN while lower power consump-tion.

AB To the best of our knowledge, there have been very few work on computational algorithms for the core or its variants in MC-nets games. One exception is the work by [Hirayama, et.al., 2014], where a constraint generation algorithm has been proposed to compute a payoff vector belonging to the least core. In this paper, we generalize this algorithm into the one for finding a payoff vector belonging to epsilon-core with pre-specified bound guarantee. The underlying idea behind this algorithm is basically the same as the previous one, but one key contribution is to give a clearer view on the pricing problem leading to the development of our new general algorithm. We showed that this new algorithm was correct and never be trapped in an infinite loop. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrated that this algorithm really presented a trade-off between solution quality and computational costs on some benchmark instances.

   selective class
AB In this paper, we propose a selective membership infer-ence attack method that determines whether certain data corresponding to a specific class are being used as training data for a machine learning model or not. By using the proposed method, membership or non-membership can be inferred by generating a decision model from the prediction of the infer-ence models and training the confidence values for the data corresponding to the selected class. We used MNIST as an experimental dataset and Ten-sorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a 92.4% success rate with 5 inference models for data corresponding to a specific class.

DE key metro vehicles; loosening bolts detection; deep learning; Single
   Shot Multibox Detector (SSD); U-shaped Network (U-Net)
AB Bolts in the bogie box of metro vehicles are fasteners which are significant for bogie box structure. Effective loosening bolts de-tection in early stage can avoid the bolt loss and accident occurrence. Re-cently, detection methods based on machine vision are developed for bolt loosening. But traditional image processing and machine learning methods have high missed rate and false rate for bolts detection due to the small size and complex background. To address this problem, a loosening bolts de-fection method based on deep learning is proposed. The proposed method cascades two stages in a coarse-to-fine manner, including location stage based on the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) and the improved SSD sequentially localizing the bogie box and bolts and a semantic segmenta-tion stage with the U-shaped Network (U-Net) to detect the looseness of the bolts. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are ver-ified with images captured from the Shanghai Metro Line 9. The results show that the proposed method has a higher accuracy in detecting the bolts loosening, which can guarantee the stable operation of the metro vehicles.

AB In order to obtain a feasible schedule of a hard real-time system, heuristic based techniques are the solution of choice. In the last few years, optimization solvers have gained attention from research communities due to their capability of handling large number of constraints. Recently, some works have used integer linear programming (ILP) for solving mono processor scheduling of real-time systems. In fact, ILP is commonly used for static scheduling of multiprocessor systems. However, two main solvers are used to solve the problem indistinctly. But, which one is the best for obtaining a schedulable system for hard real-time systems? This paper makes a comparison of two well-known optimization software packages (CPLEX and GUROBI) for the problem of finding a feasible schedule on monoprocessor hard real-time systems.

However, performing the exercises remotely (e.g., due to the COVID-19 pandemic) resulted in difficulties due to factors such as the dependency of the work environment on specific operating systems, narrow-band networks, as well as issues in providing support for configuring UMLs. In this paper, a novel web-based hands-on system with intuitive and seamless operability and lightweight responsiveness is proposed in order to allow performing the considered exercises while avoiding the mentioned shortcomings. The system provides web pages for editing device layouts and cable connections by mouse operations intuitively, web pages connecting to UML terminals, and web pages for operating X clients running on UMLs. We carried out experiments for evaluating the proposed system on the usability, system performance, and quality of experience. The subjects offered positive assessments on the operability and no negative assessments on the responsiveness. As for command inputs in terminals, the response time was shorter and the traffic was much smaller in comparison with the older system. Furthermore, the exercises using nano required at least 16 kbps bandwidth and ones using wireshark required at least 2048 kbps bandwidth.

ID COMPLEXITY
AB A vertex subset I of a graph G is called a k-path vertex cover if every path on k vertices in G contains at least one vertex from I. The k-P ath V ertex C over R econfiguration (k-PVCR) problem asks if one can transform one k-path vertex cover into another via a sequence of kpath vertex covers where each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor by applying a given reconfiguration rule exactly once. We investigate the computational complexity of k-PVCR from the viewpoint of graph classes under the well-known reconfiguration rules: TS, TJ, and TAR. The problem for k = 2, known as the Vertex Cover Reconfiguration (VCR) problem, has been well-studied in the literature. We show that certain known hardness results for VCR on different graph classes can be extended for k-PVCR. In particular, we prove a complexity dichotomy for k-PVCR on general graphs: on those whose maximum degree is three (and even planar), the problem is PSPACE-complete, while on those whose maximum degree is two (i.e., paths and cycles), the problem can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally, we also design polynomial-time algorithms for k-PVCR on trees under each of TJ and TAR. Moreover, on paths, cycles, and trees, we describe how one can construct a reconfiguration sequence between two given k-path vertex covers in a yes-instance. In particular, on paths, our constructed reconfiguration sequence is shortest.

AB Most existing object detection methods and text detection methods are mainly designed to detect either text or objects. In some scenarios where the task is to find the target word pointed-at by an object, results of existing methods are far from satisfying. However, such scenarios happen often in human-computer interaction, when the computer needs to figure out which word the user is pointing at. Comparing with object detection, pointed-at word localization (PAWL) requires higher accuracy, especially in dense text scenarios. Moreover, in printed document, characters are much smaller than those in scene text detection datasets such as ICDAR-2013, ICDAR-2015 and ICPR-2018 etc. To address these problems, the authors propose a novel target word localization network (TWLN) to detect the pointed-at word in printed documents. In this work, a single deep neural network is trained to extract the features of markers and text sequentially. For each image, the location of the marker is predicted firstly, according to the predicted location, a smaller image is cropped from the original image and put into the same network, then the location of pointed-at word is predicted. To train and test the networks, an efficient approach is proposed to generate the dataset from PDF format documents by inserting markers pointing at the words in the documents, which avoids laborious labeling work. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that TWLN outperforms the compared object detection method and optical character recognition method on every category of targets, especially when the target is a single character that only occupies several pixels in the image. TWLN is also tested with real photographs, and the accuracy shows no significant differences, which proves the validity of the generating method to construct the dataset.

DE distributed graph algorithm; maximum matching; congest model
ID PATHS
AB For a graph G = (V, E), finding a set of disjoint edges that do not share any vertices is called a matching problem, and finding the maximum matching is a fundamental problem in the theory of distributed graph algorithms. Although local algorithms for the approximate maximum matching problem have been widely studied, exact algorithms have not been much studied. In fact, no exact maximum matching algorithm that is faster than the trivial upper bound of O(n(2)) rounds is known for general instances. In this paper, we propose a randomized O(s(max)(3/2))-round algorithm in the CONGEST model, where s is the size of maximum matching. This is the first exact maximum matching algorithm in O(n(2)) rounds for general instances in the CONGEST model. The key technical ingredient of our result is a distributed algorithms of finding an augmenting path in O(s(max)) rounds, which is based on a novel technique of constructing a sparse certificate of augmenting paths, which is a subgraph of the input graph preserving at least one augmenting path. To establish a highly parallel construction of sparse certificates, we also propose a new characterization of sparse certificates, which might also be of independent interest.

AB The efficient implementation strategy for speeding up high-quality clustering algorithms is developed on the basis of general purpose graphic processing units (GPGPUs) in this work. Among various clustering algorithms, a sophisticated Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by estimating parameters through variational Bayesian (VB) mechanism is conducted due to its superior performances. Since the VB-GMM methodology is computation-hungry, the GPGPU is employed to carry out massive matrix-computations. To efficiently migrate the conventional CPU-oriented schemes of VB-GMM onto GPGPU platforms, an entire migration-flow with thirteen stages is presented in detail. The CPU-GPGPU co-operation scheme, execution re-order, and memory access optimization are proposed for optimizing the GPGPU utilization and maximizing the clustering speed. Five types of real-world applications along with relevant data-sets are introduced for the cross-validation. From the experimental results, the feasibility of implementing VB-GMM algorithm by GPGPU is verified with practical benefits. The proposed GPGPU migration achieves 192x speedup in maximum. Furthermore, it succeeded in identifying the proper number of clusters, which is hardly conducted by the EM-algotihm.

AB In ball games, acquiring skills to change the direction becomes necessary. For revealing the mechanism of skill acquisition in terms of the relevant field, it would be necessary to take an approach regarding players' cognition as well as body movements measurable from outside. In the phase of change-of-direction performance that this study focuses on, cognitive factors including the prediction of opposite players' movements and judgements of the situation have significance. The purpose of this study was to reveal cognitive transformation in the skill acquisition process for change-of-direction performance. The survey was conducted for three months from August 29 to November 28, 2020, and those surveyed were seven university freshmen belonging to women's basketball club of M University. The way to analyze verbal reports collected in order to explore the changes in the players' cognition is described in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we made a plot graph showing temporal changes in respective factors based on coding outcomes for verbal reports. Consequently, as cognitive transformation in the skill acquisition process for change-of-direction performance, four items such as (1) goal setting for skill acquisition, (2) experience of change in running direction, (3) experience of speed and acceleration, and (4) experience of the movement of lower extremities such as legs and hip joints were suggested as common cognitive transformation. In addition, cognitive transformation varied by the degree of skill acquisition for change-of-direction performance. It was indicated that paying too much attention to body feelings including the position of and shift in the center of gravity in the body posed an obstacle to the skill acquisition for change-of-direction performance.

AB In recent years, federated learning has attracted more and more attention as it could collaboratively train a global model without gathering the users' raw data. It has brought many challenges. In this paper, we proposed layer-based federated learning system with privacy preservation. We successfully reduced the communication cost by selecting several layers of the model to upload for global averaging and enhanced the privacy protection by applying local differential privacy. We evaluated our system in non independently and identically distributed scenario on three datasets. Compared with existing works, our solution achieved better performance in both model accuracy and training time.

AB In Feb 2021, As the competition for commercialization of 5G mobile communication has been increasing, 5G SA Network and Vo5G are expected to be commercialized soon. 5G mobile communication aims to provide 20 Gbps transmission speed which is 20 times faster than 4G mobile communication, connection of at least 1 million devices per 1 km(2), and 1 ms transmission delay which is 10 times shorter than 4G. To meet this, various technological developments were required, and various technologies such as Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output), mmWave, and small cell network were developed and applied in the area of 5G access network. However, in the core network area, the components constituting the LTE (Long Term Evolution) core network are utilized as they are in the NSA (Non-Standalone) architecture, and only the changes in the SA (Standalone) architecture have occurred. Also, in the network area for providing the voice service, the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) infrastructure is still used in the SA architecture. Here, the issue is that while 5G mobile communication is evolving openly to provide various services, security elements are vulnerable to various cyber-attacks because they maintain the same form as before. Therefore, in this paper, we will look at what the network standard for 5G voice service provision consists of, and what are the vulnerable problems in terms of security. And We Suggest Possible Attack Scenario using Security Issue, We also want to consider whether these problems can actually occur and what is the countermeasure.

AB Any Internet-connected device is vulnerable to being hacked and misused. Hackers can find vulnerable IoT devices, infect malicious codes, build massive IoT botnets, and remotely control IoT devices through C&C servers. Many studies have been attempted to apply various security features on IoT devices to prevent IoT devices from being exploited by attackers. However, unlike high-performance PCs, IoT devices are lightweight, low-power, and low-cost devices and have limitations on performance of processing and memory, making it difficult to install heavy security functions. Instead of access to applying security functions on IoT devices, Internet-wide scanning (e.g., Shodan) studies have been attempted to quickly discover and take security measures massive IoT devices with weak security. Over the Internet, scanning studies remotely also exist realistic limitations such as low accuracy in analyzing security vulnerabilities due to a lack of device information or filtered by network security devices. In this paper, we propose a system for remotely collecting information from Internet-connected devices and using scanning techniques to identify and manage vulnerability information from IoT devices. The proposed system improves the open-source Zmap engine to solve a realistic problem when attempting to scan through real Internet. As a result, performance measurements show equal or superior results compared to previous Shodan, Zmap-based scanning.

AB Most gait recognition approaches rely on silhouette-based representations due to high recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. A fundamental problem for those approaches is how to extract individuality-preserved silhouettes from real scenes accurately. Foreground colors may be similar to background colors, and the background is cluttered. Therefore, we propose a method of individuality-preserving silhouette extraction for gait recognition using standard gait models (SGMs) composed of clean silhouette sequences of various training subjects as shape priors. The SGMs are smoothly introduced into a well-established graph-cut segmentation framework. Experiments showed that the proposed method achieved better silhouette extraction accuracy by more than 2.3% than representative methods and better identification rate of gait recognition (improved by more than 11.0% at rank 20). Besides, to reduce the computation cost, we introduced approximation in the calculation of dynamic programming. As a result, without reducing the segmentation accuracy, we reduced 85.0% of the computational cost.

AB During the detection of maritime targets, the jitter of the shipborne camera usually causes the video instability and the false or missed detection of targets. Aimed at tackling this problem, a novel algorithm for maritime target detection based on the electronic image stabilization technology is proposed in this study. The algorithm mainly includes three models, namely the points line model (PLM), the points classification model (PCM), and the image classification model (ICM). The feature points (FPs) are firstly classified by the PLM, and stable videos as well as target contours are obtained by the PCM. Then the smallest bounding rectangles of the target contours generated as the candidate bounding boxes (bboxes) are sent to the ICM for classification. In the experiments, the ICM, which is constructed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), is trained and its effectiveness is verified. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the benchmark models in all the common metrics including the mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and mean average precision (mAP) by at least -47.87%, 8.66%, 6.94%, and 5.75%, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques in both the image stabilization and target ship detection, which provides reliable technical support for the visual development of unmanned ships.

AB Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in various fields, and it is increasingly deployed in privacy-critical domains. If sensitive data in the deep learning model are exposed, it can cause serious privacy threats. To protect individual privacy, we propose a novel activation function and stochastic gradient descent for applying differential privacy to deep learning. Through experiments, we show that the proposed method can effectively protect the privacy and the performance of proposed method is better than the previous approaches.

AB The traditional RANSAC samples uniformly in the dataset which is not efficient in the task with rich prior information. This letter proposes GUISAC (Guided Sample Consensus), which samples with the guidance of various prior information. In image matching, GUISAC extracts seed points sets evenly on images based on various prior factors at first, then it incorporates seed points sets into the sampling subset with a growth function, and a new termination criterion is used to decide whether the current best hypothesis is good enough. Finally, experimental results show that the new method GUISAC has a great advantage in time-consuming than other similar RANSAC methods, and without loss of accuracy.

AB With the spread of high-performance sensors and social network services (SNS) and the remarkable advances in machine learning technologies, fake media such as fake videos, spoofed voices, and fake reviews that are generated using high-quality learning data and are very close to the real thing are causing serious social problems. We launched a research project, the Media Clone (MC) project, to protect receivers of replicas of real media called media clones (MCs) skillfully fabricated by means of media processing technologies. Our aim is to achieve a communication system that can defend against MC attacks and help ensure safe and reliable communication. This paper describes the results of research in two of the five themes in the MC project: 1) verification of the capability of generating various types of media clones such as audio, visual, and text derived from fake information and 2) realization of a protection shield for media clones' attacks by recognizing them.

TI A Rabin-Karp Implementation for Handling Multiple Pattern-Matching on

AB The volume of digital information is growing at an extremely fast pace which, in turn, exacerbates the need of efficient mechanisms to find the presence of a pattern in an input text or a set of input strings. Combining the processing power of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with matching algorithms seems a natural alternative to speedup the string-matching process. This work proposes a Parallel Rabin-Karp implementation (PRK) that encompasses a fast-parallel prefix-sums algorithm to maximize parallelization and accelerate the matching verification. Given an input text T of length n and p patterns of length m, the proposed implementation finds all occurrences of p in T in O(m + q + n/tau + nm/q) time, where q is a sufficiently large prime number and tau is the available number of threads. Sequential and parallel versions of the PRK have been implemented. Experiments have been executed on p >= 1 patterns of length m comprising of m = 10, 20, 30 characters which are compared against a text string of length n = 2(27). The results show that the parallel implementation of the PRK algorithm on NVIDIA V100 GPU provides speedup surpassing 372 times when compared to the sequential implementation and speedup of 12.59 times against an OpenMP implementation running on a multi-core server with 128 threads. Compared to another prominent GPU implementation, the PRK implementation attained speedup surpassing 37 times.

AB In this paper, we propose a secure computation of sparse coding and its application to Encryption-then-Compression (EtC) systems. The proposed scheme introduces secure sparse coding that allows computation of an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm in an encrypted domain. We prove theoretically that the proposed method estimates exactly the same sparse representations that the OMP algorithm for non-encrypted computation does. This means that there is no degradation of the sparse representation performance. Furthermore, the proposed method can control the sparsity without decoding the encrypted signals. Next, we propose an EtC system based on the secure sparse coding. The proposed secure EtC system can protect the private information of the original image contents while performing image compression. It provides the same rate-distortion performance as that of sparse coding without encryption, as demonstrated on both synthetic data and natural images.

AB In IoT systems, data acquired by many sensors are required. However, since sensor operation depends on the actual environment, it is important to ensure sensor redundancy to improve system reliability in IoT systems. To evaluate the safety of the system, it is important to estimate the achievement probability of the function based on the sensing probability. In this research, we proposed a method to automatically generate a PRISM model from the sensor configuration of the target system and calculate and verify the function achievement probability in the assumed environment. By designing and evaluating iteratively until the target achievement probability is reached, the reliability of the system can be estimated at the initial design phase. This method reduces the possibility that the lack of reliability will be found after implementation and the redesign accompanying it will occur.

AB Cybersecurity has become a serious concern in our daily lives. The malicious functions inserted into hardware devices have been well known as hardware Trojans. In this letter, we propose a hardware-Trojan classification method at gate-level netlists utilizing boundary net structures. We first use a machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection method and classify the nets in a given netlist into a set of normal nets and a set of Trojan nets. Based on the classification results, we investigate the net structures around the boundary between normal nets and Trojan nets, and extract the features of the nets mistakenly identified to be normal nets or Trojan nets. Finally, based on the extracted features of the boundary nets, we again classify the nets in a given netlist into a set of normal nets and a set of Trojan nets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms an existing machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection method in terms of its true positive rate.

AB Faster R-CNN uses a region proposal network which consists of a single scale convolution filter and fully connected networks to localize detected regions. However, using a single scale filter is not enough to detect full regions of characters. In this letter, we propose a simple but effective way, i.e., utilizing variously sized convolution filters, to accurately detect Chinese characters of multiple scales in documents. We experimentally verified that our method improved IoU by 4% and detection rate by 3% than the previous single scale Faster R-CNN method.

AB This paper presents a series of secure PIN/password input methods resilient to shoulder hacking. When a person inputs a PIN or password to a smartphone, tablet, banking terminal, etc., there is a risk of shoulder hacking of the PIN or the password being stolen. To decrease the risk, we propose a method that erases key-top labels, moves them smoothly and simultaneously, and lets the user touch the target key after they stopped. The user only needs to trace a single key, but peepers have to trace the movements of all the keys at the same time. We extend the method by assigning different colors, shapes, and/or sizes to keys for enhancing distinguishability, which allows all the keys to be moved instantaneously after key-top labels are erased and the user to touch the target key. We also introduce a "move backward/forward" function that allows the user to play back the movements. This series of methods does not have the highest security, but it is easy to use and does not require any changes to the server side. Results of a performance evaluation demonstrate that this method has high resistance to shoulder hacking while providing satisfactory usability without large input errors.

AB In partial label data, the ground-truth label of a training example is concealed in a set of candidate labels associated with the instance. As the ground-truth label is inaccessible, it is difficult to train the classifier via the label information. Consequently, manifold structure information is adopted, which is under the assumption that neighbor/similar instances in the feature space have similar labels in the label space. However, the real-world data may not fully satisfy this assumption. In this paper, a partial label metric learning method based on likelihood-ratio test is proposed to make partial label data satisfy the manifold assumption. Moreover, the proposed method needs no objective function and treats the data pairs asymmetrically. The experimental results on several real-world PLL datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing partial label metric learning methods in terms of classification accuracy and disambiguation accuracy while costs less time.

DE computer art; stained glass image; data hiding; region growing; covert
   communication; watermarking; image authentication
AB The two issues of art image creation and data hiding are integrated into one and solved by a single approach in this study. An automatic method for generating a new type of computer art, called stained glass image, which imitates the stained-glass window picture, is proposed. The method is based on the use of a tree structure for region growing to construct the art image. Also proposed is a data hiding method which utilizes a general feature of the tree structure, namely, number of tree nodes, to encode the data to be embedded. The method can be modified for uses in three information protection applications, namely, covert communication, watermarking, and image authentication. Besides the artistic stego-image content which may distract the hacker's attention to the hidden data, data security is also considered by randomizing both the input data and the seed locations for region growing, yielding a stego-image which is robust against the hacker's attacks. Good experimental results proving the feasibility of the proposed methods are also included.

TI An FPGA-Based Change-Point Detection for 10Gbps Packet Stream

DE Change-point detection; FPGA NIC; 10GbE
AB In statistical analysis and data mining, change-point detection that identifies the change-points which are times when the probability distribution of time series changes has been used for various purposes, such as anomaly detections on network traffic and transaction data. However, computation cost of a conventional AR (Auto-Regression) model based approach is too high and infeasible for online. In this paper, an AR model based online change-point detection algorithm, called Change-Finder, is implemented on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based NIC (Network Interface Card). The proposed system computes the change-point score from time series data received from 10GbE (10Gbit Ethernet). More specifically, it computes the change-point score at the 10GbE NIC in advance of host applications. It can find change-points on single or multiple streams using a context memory. This paper aims to reduce the host workload and improve change-point detection performance by offloading ChangeFinder algorithm from host to the NIC. As evaluations, change-point detection in the FPGA NIC is compared with a baseline software implementation and those enhanced by two network optimization techniques using DPDK and Netfilter in terms of throughput. The result demonstrates 16.8x improvement in change-point detection throughput compared to the baseline software implementation. It is corresponding to the 10GbE line rate. Performance and area overheads when supporting multiple streams are also evaluated.

AB Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a promising technology for low-energy and high-capacity main memory of computers. The characteristics of NVM devices, however, tend to be fundamentally different from those of DRAM (i.e., the memory device currently used for main memory), because of differences in principles of memory cells. Typically, the write latency of an NVM device such as PCM and ReRAM is much higher than its read latency. The asymmetry in read/write latencies likely affects the performance of applications significantly. For analyzing behavior of applications running on NVM-based main memory, most researchers use software-based emulation tools due to the limited number of commercial NVM products. However, these existing emulation tools are too slow to emulate a large-scale, realistic workload or too simplistic to investigate the details of application behavior on NVM with asymmetric read/write latencies. This paper therefore proposes a new NVM emulation mechanism that is not only light-weight but also aware of a read/write latency gap in NVM-based main memory. We implemented the prototype of the proposed mechanism for the Intel CPU processors of the Haswell architecture. We also evaluated its accuracy and performed case studies for practical benchmarks. The results showed that our prototype accurately emulated write-latencies of NVM-based main memory: it emulated the NVM write latencies in a range from 200 ns to 1000 ns with negligible errors from 0.2% to 1.1%. We confirmed that the use of our emulator enabled us to successfully estimate performance of practical workloads for NVM-based main memory, while an existing light-weight emulation model misestimated.

AB Human gender recognition in the wild is a challenging task due to complex face variations, such as poses, lighting, occlusions, etc. In this letter, learnable Gabor convolutional network (LGCN), a new neural network computing framework for gender recognition was proposed. In LGCN, a learnable Gabor filter (LGF) is introduced and combined with the convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the proposed framework is constructed by replacing some first layer convolutional kernels of a standard CNN with LGFs. Here, LGFs learn intrinsic parameters by using standard back propagation method, so that the values of those parameters are no longer fixed by experience as traditional methods, but can be modified by self-learning automatically. In addition, the performance of LGCN in gender recognition is further improved by applying a proposed feature combination strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the standard CNNs with identical network architecture, our approach achieves better performance on three challenging public datasets without introducing any sacrifice in parameter size.

AB Heat map is an important tool for eye tracking data analysis and visualization. It is very intuitive to express the area watched by observer, but ignores saccade information that expresses gaze shift. Based on conventional heat map generation method, this paper presents a novel heat map generation method for eye tracking data. The proposed method introduces a mixed data structure of fixation points and saccades, and considers heat map deformation for saccade type data. The proposed method has advantages on indicating gaze transition direction while visualizing gaze region.

AB In this paper, a nonoverlapping multi-camera and people re-identification algorithm is proposed. It applies inflated major color features for re-identification to reduce computation time. The inflated major color features can dramatically improve efficiency while retaining high accuracy of object re-identification. The proposed method is evaluated over a wide range of experimental databases. The accuracy attains upwards of 40.7% in Rank 1 and 84% in Rank 10 on average, while it obtains three to 15 times faster than algorithms reported in the literature. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a SOC-FPGA platform to reach 50 FPS with 1280x720 HD resolution and 25 FPS with 1920x1080 FHD resolution for real-time processing. The results show a performance improvement and reduction in computation complexity, which is especially ideal for embedded platform.

AB This letter proposes a fast superpixel segmentation method based on boundary sampling and interpolation. The basic idea is as follow: instead of labeling local region pixels, we estimate superpixel boundary by interpolating candidate boundary pixel from a down-sampling image segmentation. On the one hand, there exists high spatial redundancy within each local region, which could be discarded. On the other hand, we estimate the labels of candidate boundary pixels via sampling superpixel boundary within corresponding neighbour. Benefiting from the reduction of candidate pixel distance calculation, the proposed method significantly accelerates superpixel segmentation. Experiments on BSD500 benchmark demonstrate that our method needs half the time compared with the state-of-the-arts while almost no accuracy reduction.

AB Many users are exposed to threats of drive-by download attacks through the Web. Attackers compromise vulnerable websites discovered by search engines and redirect clients to malicious websites created with exploit kits. Security researchers and vendors have tried to prevent the attacks by detecting malicious data, i.e., malicious URLs, web content, and redirections. However, attackers conceal parts of malicious data with evasion techniques to circumvent detection systems. In this paper, we propose a system for detecting malicious websites without collecting all malicious data. Even if we cannot observe parts of malicious data, we can always observe compromised websites. Since vulnerable websites are discovered by search engines, compromised websites have similar traits. Therefore, we built a classifier by leveraging not only malicious but also compromised websites. More precisely, we convert all websites observed at the time of access into a redirection graph and classify it by integrating similarities between its subgraphs and redirection subgraphs shared across malicious, benign, and compromised websites. As a result of evaluating our system with crawling data of 455,860 websites, we found that the system achieved a 91.7% true positive rate for malicious websites containing exploit URLs at a low false positive rate of 0.1%. Moreover, it detected 143 more evasive malicious websites than the conventional content-based system.

AB Let G = (V, E) be an unweighted simple graph. A distance-d independent set is a subset I subset of V such that dist(u, v) >= d for any two vertices u, v in I, where dist(u, v) is the distance between u and v. Then, Maximum Distance-d Independent Set problem requires to compute the size of a distance-d independent set with the maximum number of vertices. Even for a fixed integer d >= 3, this problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we design an exact exponential algorithm that calculates the size of a maximum distance-3 independent set in O(1.4143(n)) time.

DT Article
DE documentation; README; association rule mining; JavaScript packages
AB Contemporary software projects often utilize a README.md to share crucial information such as installation and usage examples related to their software. Furthermore, these files serve as an important source of updated and useful documentation for developers and prospective users of the software. Nonetheless, both novice and seasoned developers are sometimes unsure of what is required for a good README file. To understand the contents of README, we investigate the contents of 43,900 JavaScript packages. Results show that these packages contain common content themes (i.e., 'usage', 'install' and 'license'). Furthermore, we find that application-specific packages more frequently included content themes such as 'options', while library-based packages more frequently included other specific content themes (i.e., 'install' and 'license').

ID ROBUST OBJECT TRACKING; PARTICLE FILTER
AB Sparse representation has been successfully applied to visual tracking. Recent progresses in sparse tracking are mainly made within the particle filter framework. However, most sparse trackers need to extract complex feature representations for each particle in the limited sample space, leading to expensive computation cost and yielding inferior tracking performance. To deal with the above issues, we propose a novel sparse tracking method based on the circulant reverse lasso model. Benefiting from the properties of circulant matrices, densely sampled target candidates are implicitly generated by cyclically shifting the base feature descriptors, and then embedded into a reverse sparse reconstruction model as a dictionary to encode a robust appearance template. The alternating direction method of multipliers is employed for solving the reverse sparse model and the optimization process can be efficiently solved in the frequency domain, which enables the proposed tracker to run in real-time. The calculated sparse coefficient map represents the similarity scores between the template and circular shifted samples. Thus the target location can be directly predicted according to the coordinates of the peak coefficient. A scale-aware template updating strategy is combined with the correlation filter template learning to take into account both appearance deformations and scale variations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art sparse representation based tracking methods.

AB Head action recognition, as a specific problem in action recognition, has been studied in this paper. Different from most existing researches, our head action recognition problem is specifically defined for the requirement of some practical applications. Based on our definition, we build a corresponding head action dataset which contains many challenging cases. For action recognition, we proposed a real-time head action recognition framework based on HOF and ELM. The framework consists of face detection based ROI determination, HOF feature extraction in ROI, and ELM based action prediction. Experiments show that our method achieves good accuracy and is efficient enough for practical applications.

TI On-Demand Generalization of Road Networks Based on Facility Search

DE road generalization; web map service; stroke
AB Road generalization is a method for thinning out road networks to allow easy viewing according to the size of the map. Most conventional road generalization methods mainly focus on the length of a stroke, which is a chain of links with good continuity based on the principle of perceptual grouping applied to network data such as roads and rivers. However, in the case of facility search in a web map service, for example, a "restaurant guide map," a road generalization mechanism can be more effective if it depends not only on the stroke length but also on the facility search results. Accordingly, in this study, we implement an on-demand road generalization method that adapts to both the facility search results and the stroke length. Moreover, a sufficiently fast response speed is achieved for practical use in web map services. In particular, this study proposes a fat-stroke model that links facility information to individual strokes and implements a road generalization method that uses this model to improve the response time. In addition, we develop a prototype based on the proposed system. The system evaluation results are based on three indicators, namely, response time of the road generalization system, connectivity between strokes, and connectivity between stroke and facilities. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed method can yield improved response times by a factor of 100 or more while affording higher connectivity.

AB In terms of spatial online aggregation, traditional standalone serial methods gradually become limited. Although parallel computing is widely studied nowadays, there scarcely has research conducted on the index-based parallel online aggregation methods, specifically for spatial data. In this letter, a parallel multilevel indexing method is proposed to accelerate spatial online aggregation analyses, which contains two steps. In the first step, a parallel aR tree index is built to accelerate aggregate query locally. In the second step, a multilevel sampling data pyramid structure is built based on the parallel aR tree index, which contribute to the concurrent returned query results with certain confidence degree. Experimental and analytical results verify that the methods are capable of handling billion-scale data.

AB The security of a software program critically depends on the prevention of vulnerabilities in the source code; however, conventional computer programs lack the ability to identify vulnerable code in another program. Our research was aimed at developing a technique capable of generating substitution code for the detection of buffer overflow vulnerability in C/C++ programs. The technique automatically verifies and sanitizes code instrumentation by comparing the result of each candidate variable with that expected from the input data. Our results showed that statements containing buffer overflow vulnerabilities could be detected and prevented by using a substitution variable and by sanitizing code vulnerabilities based on the size of the variables. Thus, faults can be detected prior to execution of the statement, preventing malicious access. Our approach is particularly useful for enhancing software security monitoring, and for designing retrofitting techniques in applications.

AB High-performance computing (HPC) has penetrated into various research fields, yet the increase in computing power is limited by conventional electrical interconnections. The proposed architecture, NEST, exploits wavelength routing in arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWGRs) to achieve a scalable, low-latency, and high-throughput network. For the intra pod and inter pod communication, the symmetrical topology of NEST reduces the network diameter, which leads to an increase in latency performance. Moreover, the proposed architecture enables exponential growth of network size. Simulation results demonstrate that NEST shows 36% latency improvement and 30% throughput improvement over the dragonfly on an average.

AB A new hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI), which is based on sequential controls by eye tracking and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), has been proposed for high-speed spelling in virtual reality (VR) with a 40-target virtual keyboard. During target selection, gaze point was first detected by an eye-tracking accessory. A 4-target block was then selected for further target selection by a 4-class SSVEP BCI. The system can type at a speed of 1.25 character/sec in a cue-guided target selection task. Online experiments on three subjects achieved an averaged information transfer rate (ITR) of 360.7 bits/min.

TI Spectrum-Based Fault Localization Using Fault Triggering Model to Refine
   Fault Ranking List
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE fault localization; software debugging; testing
AB Spectrum-based fault localization (SFL) is a lightweight approach, which aims at helping debuggers to identity root causes of failures by measuring suspiciousness for each program component being a fault, and generate a hypothetical fault ranking list. Although SFL techniques have been shown to be effective, the fault component in a buggy program cannot always be ranked at the top due to its complex fault triggering models. However, it is extremely difficult to model the complex triggering models for all buggy programs. To solve this issue, we propose two simple fault triggering models (RIPR alpha and RIPR beta), and a refinement technique to improve fault absolute ranking based on the two fault triggering models, through ruling out some higher ranked components according to its fault triggering model. Intuitively, our approach is effective if a fault component was ranked within top k in the two fault ranking lists outputted by the two fault localization strategies. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the fault absolute ranking in the three cases.

AB Optical interconnect is a promising candidate for network on chip. As the key element in the network on chip, the routers greatly affect the performance of the whole system. In this letter, we proposed a new router architecture, Waffle, based on compact 2 x 2 hybrid photonicplasmonic switching elements. Also, an optimized architecture, Waffle-XY, was designed for the network employed XY routing algorithm. Both Waffle and Waffle-XY are strictly non-blocking architectures and can be employed in the popular mesh-like networks. Theoretical analysis illustrated that Waffle and Waffle-XY possessed a better performance compared with several representative routers.

AB PCANet, as one noticeable shallow network, employs the histogram representation for feature pooling. However, there are three main problems about this kind of pooling method. First, the histogram-based pooling method binarizes the feature maps and leads to inevitable discriminative information loss. Second, it is difficult to effectively combine other visual cues into a compact representation, because the simple concatenation of various visual cues leads to feature representation inefficiency. Third, the dimensionality of histogram-based output grows exponentially with the number of feature maps used. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel shallow network model, named as PCANet-II. Compared with the histogram-based output, the second order pooling not only provides more discriminative information by preserving both the magnitude and sign of convolutional responses, but also dramatically reduces the size of output features. Thus we combine the second order statistical pooling method with the shallow network, i.e., PCANet. Moreover, it is easy to combine other discriminative and robust cues by using the second order pooling. So we introduce the binary feature difference encoding scheme into our PCANet-II to further improve robustness. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed PCANet-II method.

ID EMERGENCY RESPONSE
AB During the execution of software, tremendous amounts of data can be recorded. By exploiting the execution data, one can discover behavioral models to describe the actual software execution. As a wellknown open-source process mining toolkit, ProM integrates quantities of process mining techniques and enjoys a variety of applications in a broad range of areas. How to develop a better ProM software, both from user experience and software performance perspective, are of vital importance. To achieve this goal, we need to investigate the real execution behavior of ProM which can provide useful insights on its usage and how it responds to user operations. This paper aims to propose an effective approach to solve this problem. To this end, we first instrument existing ProM framework to capture execution logs without changing its architecture. Then a two-layered framework is introduced to support accurate ProM behavior discovery by characterizing both user interaction behavior and plug-in calling behavior separately. Next, detailed discovery techniques to obtain user interaction behavior model and plug-in calling behavior model are proposed. All proposed approaches have been implemented.

AB Although Wolf Pack Algorithm (WPA) is a novel optimal algorithm with good performance, there is still room for improvement with respect to its convergence. In order to speed up its convergence and strengthen the search ability, we improve WPA with the Differential Evolution (DE) elite set strategy. The new proposed algorithm is called the WPADEES for short. WPADEES is faster than WPA in convergence, and it has a more feasible adaptability for various optimizations. Six standard benchmark functions are applied to verify the effects of these improvements. Our experiments show that the performance of WPADEES is superior to the standard WPA and other intelligence optimal algorithms, such as GA, DE, PSO, and ABC, in several situations.

AB A vertex subset F subset of V(G) is called a cyclic vertex-cut set of a connected graph G if G - F is disconnected such that at least two components in G - F contain cycles. The cyclic vertex connectivity is the cardinality of a minimum cyclic vertex-cut set. In this paper, we show that the cyclic vertex connectivity of the trivalent Cayley graphs TG(n) is equal to eight for n >= 4.

ID VIDEO STABILIZATION; TRACKING
AB A lot of vision systems have been embedded in devices around us, like mobile phones, vehicles and UAVs. Many of them still need interactive operations of human users. However, specifying accurate object information could be a challenging task due to video jitters caused by camera shakes and target motions. In this paper, we first collect practical hand drawn bounding boxes on real-life videos which are captured by hand-held cameras and UAV-based cameras. We give a deep look into human-computer interactive operations on unstable images. The collected data shows that human input suffers heavy deviations which are harmful to interaction accuracy. To achieve robust interactions on unstable platforms, we propose a target-focused video stabilization method which utilizes a proposal-based object detector and a tracking-based motion estimation component. This method starts with a single manual click and outputs stabilized video stream in which the specified target stays almost stationary. Our method removes not only camera jitters but also target motions simultaneously, therefore offering an comfortable environment for users to do further interactive operations. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively eliminates image vibrations and significantly increases human input accuracy.

AB In this paper, we consider Bayesian image denoising based on a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model, for which we propose an new algorithm. Our method can solve Bayesian image denoising problems, including hyperparameter estimation, in O(n)-time, where n is the number of pixels in a given image. From the perspective of the order of the computational time, this is a state-of-the-art algorithm for the present problem setting. Moreover, the results of our numerical experiments we show our method is in fact effective in practice.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, the problem of lifetime extension of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with redundant sensor nodes deployed in 3D vegetation-covered fields is modeled, which includes building communication models, network model and energy model. Generally, such a problem cannot be solved by a conventional method directly. Here we propose an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based optimal grouping algorithm (ABC-OG) to solve it. The main contribution of the algorithm is to find the optimal number of feasible subsets (FSs) of WSN and assign them to work in rotation. It is verified that reasonably grouping sensors into FSs can average the network energy consumption and prolong the lifetime of the network. In order to further verify the effectiveness of ABC-OG, two other algorithms are included for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed ABC-OG algorithm provides better optimization performance.

AB Distributed control plane architecture has been employed in software-defined data center networks to improve the scalability of control plane. However, since the flow space is partitioned by assigning switches to different controllers, the network topology is also partitioned and the rule setup process has to invoke multiple controllers. Besides, the control load balancing based on switch migration is heavyweight. In this paper, we propose a lightweight load partition method which decouples the flow space from the network topology. The flow space is partitioned with hosts rather than switches as carriers, which supports fine-grained and lightweight load balancing. Moreover, the switches are no longer needed to be assigned to different controllers and we keep all of them controlled by each controller, thus each flow request can be processed by exactly one controller in a centralized style. Evaluations show that our scheme reduces rule setup costs and achieves lightweight load balancing.

AB The correlation filter-based trackers with an appearance model established by single feature have poor robustness to challenging video environment which includes factors such as occlusion, fast motion and out-of-view. In this paper, a long-term tracking algorithm based on multi-feature adaptive fusion for video target is presented. We design a robust appearance model by fusing powerful features including histogram of gradient, local binary pattern and color-naming at response map level to conquer the interference in the video. In addition, a random fern classifier is trained as re-detector to detect target when tracking failure occurs, so that long-term tracking is implemented. We evaluate our algorithm on large-scale benchmark datasets and the results show that the proposed algorithm have more accurate and more robust performance in complex video environment.

AB Topic modeling as a well-known method is widely applied for not only text data mining but also multimedia data analysis such as video data analysis. However, existing models cannot adequately handle time dependency and multimodal data modeling for video data that generally contain image information and speech information. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel topic model, sequential symmetric correspondence hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Seq-Sym-cHDP) extended from sequential conditionally independent hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Seq-CI-HDP) and sequential correspondence hierarchical Dirichlet processes (Seq-cHDP), to improve the multimodal data modeling mechanism via controlling the pivot assignments with a latent variable. An inference scheme for Seq-Sym-cHDP based on a posterior representation sampler is also developed in this work. We finally demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline models via experiments.

AB As the emergence and the thriving development of social networks, a huge number of short texts are accumulated and need to be processed. Inferring latent topics of collected short texts is an essential task for understanding its hidden structure and predicting new contents. A biterm topic model (BTM) was recently proposed for short texts to overcome the sparseness of document-level word co-occurrences by directly modeling the generation process of word pairs. Stochastic inference algorithms based on collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) and collapsed variational inference have been proposed for BTM. However, they either require large computational complexity, or rely on very crude estimation that does not preserve sufficient statistics. In this work, we develop a stochastic divergence minimization (SDM) inference algorithm for BTM to achieve better predictive likelihood in a scalable way. Experiments show that SDM-BTM trained by 30% data outperforms the best existing algorithm trained by full data.

TI Multi-Dimensional Bloom Filter: Design and Evaluation

DT Article
DE Bloom Filter; multi-dimensional matrix; false positive rates
AB Bloom Filter is a bit array (a one-dimensional storage structure) that provides a compact representation for a set of data, which can be used to answer the membership query in an efficient manner with a small number of false positives. It has a lot of applications in many areas. In this paper, we extend the design of Bloom Filter by using a multidimensional matrix to replace the one-dimensional structure with three different implementations, namely OFFF, WOFF, FFF. We refer the extended Bloom Filter as Feng Filter. We show the false positive rates of our method. We compare the false positive rate of OFFF with that of the traditional one-dimensional Bloom Filter and show that under certain condition, OFFF has a lower false positive rate. Traditional Bloom Filter can be regarded as a special case of our Feng Filter.

DE question retrieval; cQA service; dependency; language model
AB The translation based language model (TRLM) is state-of-the-art method to solve the lexical gap problem of the question retrieval in the community-based question answering (cQA). Some researchers tried to find methods for solving the lexical gap and improving the TRLM. In this paper, we propose a new dependency based model (DM) for the question retrieval. We explore how to utilize the results of a dependency parser for cQA. Dependency bigrams are extracted from the dependency parser and the language model is transformed using the dependency bigrams as bigram features. As a result, we obtain the significant improved performances when TRLM and DM approaches are effectively combined.

AB The quality assessment of screen content images (SCIs) has been attractive recently. Different from natural images, SCI is usually a mixture of picture and text. Traditional quality metrics are mainly designed for natural images, which do not fit well into the SCIs. Motivated by this, this letter presents a simple and effective method to naturalize SCIs, so that the traditional quality models can be applied for SCI quality prediction. Specifically, bicubic interpolation-based up-sampling is proposed to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Restoration is an important area in improving the visual quality, and lays the foundation for accurate object detection or terrain classification in image analysis. In this paper, we introduce Beta process priors into hierarchical sparse Bayesian learning for recovering underlying degraded hyperspectral images (HSI), including suppressing the various noises and inferring the missing data. The proposed method decomposes the HSI into the weighted summation of the dictionary elements, Gaussian noise term and sparse noise term. With these, the latent information and the noise characteristics of HSI can be well learned and represented. Solved by Gibbs sampler, the underlying dictionary and the noise can be efficiently predicted with no tuning of any parameters. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art ones and validated on two hyperspectral datasets, which are contaminated with the Gaussian noises, impulse noises, stripes and dead pixel lines, or with a large number of data missing uniformly at random. The visual and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

ID QUANTIZATION INDEX MODULATION; SPREAD-SPECTRUM WATERMARKING
AB We propose a digital image watermarking method satisfying information hiding criteria (IHC) for robustness against JPEG compression, cropping, scaling, and rotation. When a stego-image is cropped, the marking positions of watermarks are unclear. To detect the position in a cropped stego-image, a marker or synchronization code is embedded with the watermarks in a lattice pattern. Attacks by JPEG compression, scaling, and rotation cause errors in extracted watermarks. Against such errors, the same watermarks are repeatedly embedded in several areas. The number of errors in the extracted watermarks can be reduced by using a weighted majority voting (WMV) algorithm. To correct residual errors in output of the WMV algorithm, we use a high-performance error-correcting code: a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code constructed by progressive edge-growth (PEG). In computer simulations using the IHC ver. 4 the proposed method could a bit error rate of 0, the average PSNR was 41.136 dB, and the computational time for synchronization recovery was less than 10 seconds. The proposed method can thus provide high image quality and fast synchronization recovery.

AB Within information hiding technology, digital watermarking is one of the most important technologies for copyright protection of digital content. Many digital watermarking schemes have been proposed in academia. However, these schemes are not used, because they are not practical; one reason for this is that the evaluation criteria are loosely defined. To make the evaluation more concrete and improve the practicality of digital watermarking, watermarking schemes must use common evaluation criteria. To realize such criteria, we organized the Information Hiding and its Criteria for Evaluation (IHC) Committee to create useful, globally accepted evaluation criteria for information hiding technology. The IHC Committee improves their evaluation criteria every year, and holds a competition for digital watermarking based on state-of-the-art evaluation criteria. In this paper, we describe the activities of the IHC Committee and its evaluation criteria for digital watermarking of still images, videos, and audio.

AB Many hemodialysis patients undergo plasitc surgery to form the arterio-venous fistula (AVF) in their forearm to improve the vascular access by shunting blood flows. The issue of AVF is the stenosis caused by the disturbance of blood flows; therefore the auscultation system to assist the stenosis diagnosis has been developed. Although the system is intended to be used as a steady monitoring for stenosis assessment, its efficiency was not always high because it cannot estimate where the stenosis locates. In this study, for extracting and estimating the stenosis signal, the shunt murmurs captured by many microphones were decomposed by the principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, applying the hierarchical categorization of the recursive subdivision self-organizing map (rs-SOM), the modelling of the stenosis signal was proposed to realise the effective stenosis assessment. The false-positive rate of the stenosis assessment was significantly reduced by using the improved auscultation system.

AB We previously proposed an unsupervised model using the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute sentence information content. Though it can achieve desirable experimental results in sentence semantic similarity, the computational complexity is more than O(2(n)). In this paper, we propose an efficient method to calculate sentence information content, which employs the thinking of the difference set in hierarchical network. Impressively, experimental results show that the computational complexity decreases to O(n). We prove the algorithm in the form of theorems. Performance analysis and experiments are also provided.

AB Sound localization systems are widely studied and have several potential applications, including hearing aid devices, surveillance and robotics. However, few proposed solutions target portable systems, such as wearable devices, which require a small unnoticeable platform, or unmanned aerial vehicles, in which weight and low power consumption are critical aspects. The main objective of this research is to achieve real-time sound localization capability in a small, self-contained device, without having to rely on large shaped platforms or complex microphone arrays. The proposed device has two surface-mount microphones spaced only 20 mm apart. Such reduced dimensions present challenges for the implementation, as differences in level and spectra become negligible, and only time-difference of arrival (TDoA) can be used as a localization cue. Three main issues have to be addressed in order to accomplish these objectives. To achieve real-time processing, the TDoA is calculated using zero-crossing spikes applied to the hardware-friendly Jeffers model. In order to make up for the reduction in resolution due to the small dimensions, the signal is upsampled several-fold within the system. Finally, a coherence-based spectral masking is used to select only frequency components with relevant TDoA information. The proposed system was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based platform, due to the large amount of concurrent and independent tasks, which can be efficiently parallelized in reconfigurable hardware devices. Experimental results with white-noise and environmental sounds show high accuracies for both anechoic and reverberant conditions.

AB In this paper, a built-in test circuit for an electrical interconnect test method is proposed to detect an open defect occurring at an interconnect between an IC and a printed circuit board. The test method is based on measuring the supply current of an inverter gate in the test circuit. A time-varying signal is provided to an interconnect as a test signal by the built-in test circuit. In this paper, the test circuit is evaluated by SPICE simulation and by experiments with a prototyping IC. The experimental results reveal that a hard open defect is detectable by the test method in addition to a resistive open defect and a capacitive open one at a test speed of 400 kHz.

AB We consider the problem of sparse signal recovery from 1-bit measurements. Due to the noise present in the acquisition and transmission process, some quantized bits may be flipped to their opposite states. These sign flips may result in severe performance degradation. In this study, a novel algorithm, termed HISTORY, is proposed. It consists of Hamming support detection and coefficients recovery. The HISTORY algorithm has high recovery accuracy and is robust to strong measurement noise. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB With the surge of social media platform, users' profile information become treasure to enhance social network services. However, attributes information of most users are not complete, thus it is important to infer latent attributes of users. Contemporary attribute inference methods have a basic assumption that there are enough labeled data to train a model. However, in social media, it is very expensive and difficult to label a large amount of data. In this paper, we study the latent attribute inference problem with very small labeled data and propose the SRW-COND solution. In order to solve the difficulty of small labeled data, SRW-COND firstly extends labeled data with a simple but effective greedy algorithm. Then SRW-COND employs a supervised random walk process to effectively utilize the known attributes information and link structure of users. Experiments on two real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of SRW-COND.

DE projective template matching; binary finite field; level-wise adaptive
   sampling; homography estimation
AB In this paper, we address the problem of projective template matching which aims to estimate parameters of projective transformation. Although homography can be estimated by combining key-point-based local features and RANSAC, it can hardly be solved with feature-less images or high outlier rate images. Estimating the projective transformation remains a difficult problem due to high-dimensionality and strong non-convexity. Our approach is to quantize the parameters of projective transformation with binary finite field and search for an appropriate solution as the final result over the discrete sampling set. The benefit is that we can avoid searching among a huge amount of potential candidates. Furthermore, in order to approximate the global optimum more efficiently, we develop a level-wise adaptive sampling ( LAS) method under genetic algorithm framework. With LAS, the individuals are uniformly selected from each fitness level and the elite solution finally converges to the global optimum. In the experiment, we compare our method against the popular projective solution and systematically analyse our method. The result shows that our method can provide convincing performance and holds wider application scope.

ID ANONYMITY
AB Location-based services (LBSs) are useful for many applications in internet of things(IoT). However, LBSs has raised serious concerns about users' location privacy. In this paper, we propose a new location privacy attack in LBSs called hidden location inference attack, in which the adversary infers users' hidden locations based on the users' check-in histories. We discover three factors that influence individual check-in behaviors: geographic information, human mobility patterns and user preferences. We first separately evaluate the effects of each of these three factors on users' check-in behaviors. Next, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates the above heterogeneous factors and captures the probability of hidden location privacy leakage. Then, we design a novel privacy alert framework to warn users when their sharing behavior does not match their sharing rules. Finally, we use our experimental results to demonstrate the validity and practicality of the proposed strategy.

ID B+-TREE; SYSTEMS
AB In this letter, we propose a novel garbage collection technique for index structures based on flash memory systems, called Proxy Block-based Garbage Collection (PBGC). Many index structures have been proposed for flash memory systems. They exploit buffers and logs to resolve the update propagation problem, one of the a main cause of performance degradation of the index structures. However, these studies overlooked the fact that not only the record operation but also garbage collection induces the update propagation problem. The proposal, PBGC, exploits a proxy block and a block mapping table to solve the update propagation problem, which is caused by the changes in the page and block caused by garbage collection. Experiments show that PBGC decreased the execution time of garbage collection by up to 39%, compared with previous garbage collection techniques.

DE replication; replicated state machine; consensus protocol; batching;

AB We present a hierarchical replicated state machine ( HRSM) and its corresponding consensus protocol D-Paxos for replication across multiple data centers in the cloud. Our H-RSM is based on the idea of parallel processing and aims to improve resource utilization. We detail D-Paxos and theoretically prove that D-Paxos implements an H-RSM. With batching and logical pipelining, D-Paxos efficiently utilizes the idle time caused by high-latency message transmission in a wide-area network and available bandwidth in a local-area network. Experiments show that D-Paxos provides higher throughput and better scalability than other Paxos variants for replication across multiple data centers. To predict the optimal batch sizes when D-Paxos reaches its maximum throughput, an analytical model is developed theoretically and validated experimentally.

AB With the rapid merger of healthcare business and information technology, more healthcare institutions and medical practices are sharing information. Since these records often contain patients' sensitive personal information, Healthcare Information Systems (HISs) should be properly designed to manage these records in a secure manner. We propose a novel security design for the HIS complying with the security and privacy rules. The proposed system defines protocols to ensure secure delivery of medical records over insecure public networks and reliable management of medical record in the remote server without incurring excessive costs to implement services for security. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed system through a security analysis and performance evaluation.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Phishing attacks target financial returns by luring Internet users to exposure their sensitive information. Phishing originates from e-mail fraud, and recently it is also spread by social networks and short message service (SMS), which makes phishing become more widespread. Phishing attacks have drawn great attention due to their high volume and causing heavy losses, and many methods have been developed to fight against them. However, most of researches suffered low detection accuracy or high false positive (FP) rate, and phishing attacks are facing the Internet users continuously. In this paper, we are concerned about feature engineering for improving the classification performance on phishing web pages detection. We propose a novel anti-phishing framework that employs feature engineering including feature selection and feature extraction. First, we perform feature selection based on genetic algorithm (GA) to divide features into critical features and non-critical features. Then, the non-critical features are projected to a new feature by implementing feature extraction based on a two-stage projection pursuit (PP) algorithm. Finally, we take the critical features and the new feature as input data to construct the detection model. Our anti-phishing framework does not simply eliminate the non-critical features, but considers utilizing their projection in the process of classification, which is different from literatures. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective in detecting phishing web pages.

ID IMAGE BLUR
AB The the depth-of-field limitation of our eyes causes out-of-focus blur in the retinal images. The blur dynamically changes whenever we change our gaze and accordingly the scene point we are looking at changes its depth. This paper proposes an image display that reproduces retinal out-of-focus blur by using a stereoscopic display and eye trackers. Its purpose is to provide the viewer with more realistic visual experiences than conventional (stereoscopic) displays. Unlike previous similar systems that track only one of the viewer's eyes to estimate the gaze depth, the proposed system tracks both eyes individually using two eye trackers and estimates the gaze depth from the convergence angle calculated by triangulation. This provides several advantages over existing schemes, such as being able to deal with scenes having multiple depths. We describe detailed implementations of the proposed system and show the results of an experiment conducted to examine its effectiveness. In the experiment, creating a scene having two depths using two LCD displays together with a half mirror, we examined how difficult it is for viewers to distinguish between the real scene and its virtual reproduction created by the proposed display system. The results of the experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In this study, we propose a simple, yet general and powerful framework of integrating multiple global and local features by Product Sparse Coding (PSC) for image retrieval. In our framework, multiple global and local features are extracted from images and then are transformed to Trimmed-Root (TR)-features. After that, the features are encoded into compact codes by PSC. Finally, a two-stage ranking strategy is proposed for indexing in retrieval. We make three major contributions in this study. First, we propose TR representation of multiple image features and show that the TR representation offers better performance than the original features. Second, the integrated features by PSC is very compact and effective with lower complexity than by the standard sparse coding. Finally, the two-stage ranking strategy can balance the efficiency and memory usage in storage. Experiments demonstrate that our compact image representation is superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives for large-scale image retrieval.

DE peer review; Open Source Software; social network analysis
AB Software peer review is regarded as one of the most important approaches to preserving software quality. Due to the distributed collaborations in Open Source Software (OSS) development, the review techniques and processes conducted in OSS environment differ from the traditional review method that based on formal face-to-face meetings. Unlike other related works, this study investigates peer review processes of OSS projects from the social perspective: communication and interaction in peer review by using social network analysis (SNA). Moreover, the relationship between peer review contributors and their activities is studied. We propose an approach to evaluating contributors' activeness and social relationship using SNA named Peer Review Social Network (PeRSoN). We evaluate our approach by empirical case study, 326,286 review comments and 1,745 contributors from three representative industrial OSS projects have been extracted and analyzed. The results indicate that the social network structure influences the realistic activeness of contributors significantly. Based on the results, we suggest our approach can support project leaders in assigning review tasks, appointing reviewers and other activities to improve current software processes.

AB This paper proposes a method of watermarking for digital audio signals based on adaptive phase modulation. Audio signals are usually non-stationary, i.e., their own characteristics are time-variant. The features for watermarking are usually not selected by combining the principle of variability, which affects the performance of the whole watermarking system. The proposed method embeds a watermark into an audio signal by adaptively modulating its phase with the watermark using IIR all-pass filters. The frequency location of the pole-zero of an IIR all-pass filter that characterizes the transfer function of the filter is adapted on the basis of signal power distribution on sub-bands in a magnitude spectrum domain. The pole-zero locations are adapted so that the phase modulation produces slight distortion in watermarked signals to achieve the best sound quality. The experimental results show that the proposed method could embed inaudible watermarks into various kinds of audio signals and correctly detect watermarks without the aid of original signals. A reasonable trade-off between inaudibility and robustness could be obtained by balancing the phase modulation scheme. The proposed method can embed a watermark into audio signals up to 100 bits per second with 99% accuracy and 6 bits per second with 94.3% accuracy in the cases of no attack and attacks, respectively.

AB This paper focuses on the power of comments to predict fault-prone programs. In general, comments along with executable statements enhance the understandability of programs. However, comments may also be used to mask the lack of readability in the program, therefore well-written comments are referred to as "deodorant to mask code smells" in the field of code refactoring. This paper conducts an empirical analysis to examine whether Lines of Comments (LCM) written inside a method's body is a noteworthy metric for analyzing fault-proneness in Java methods. The empirical results show the following two findings: (1) more-commented methods (the methods having more comments than the amount estimated by size and complexity of the methods) are about 1.6 - 2.8 times more likely to be faulty than the others, and (2) LCM can be a useful factor in fault-prone method prediction models along with the method size and the method complexity.

AB Point spread function (PSF) estimation plays a paramount role in image deblurring processing, and traditionally it is solved by parameter estimation of a certain preassumed PSF shape model. In real life, the PSF shape is generally arbitrary and complicated, and thus it is assumed in this manuscript that a PSF may be decomposed as a weighted sum of a certain number of Gaussian kernels, with weight coefficients estimated in an alternating manner, and an l(1) norm-based total variation (TVl(1)) algorithm is adopted to recover the latent image. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance on synthetic and realistic blurred images.

TI Improvement of Colorization-Based Coding Using Optimization by Novel
   Colorization Matrix Construction and Adaptive Color Conversion
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE colorization-based coding; image compression; colorization matrix;
   edge-preserving filtering; adaptive color conversion
AB This study improves the compression efficiency of Lee's colorization-based coding framework by introducing a novel colorization matrix construction and an adaptive color conversion. Colorization-based coding methods reconstruct color components in the decoder by colorization, which adds color to a base component (a grayscale image) using scant color information. The colorization process can be expressed as a linear combination of a few column vectors of a colorization matrix. Thus it is important for colorization-based coding to make a colorization matrix whose column vectors effectively approximate color components. To make a colorization matrix, Lee's colorization-based coding framework first obtains a base and color components by RGB-YCbCr color conversion, and then performs a segmentation method on the base component. Finally, the entries of a colorization matrix are created using the segmentation results. To improve compression efficiency on this framework, we construct a colorization matrix based on a correlation of base-color components. Furthermore, we embed an edge-preserving smoothing filtering process into the colorization matrix to reduce artifacts. To achieve more improvement, our method uses adaptive color conversion instead of RGB-YCbCr color conversion. Our proposed color conversion maximizes the sum of the local variance of a base component, which resulted in increment of the difference of intensities at region boundaries. Since segmentation methods partition images based on the difference, our adaptive color conversion leads to better segmentation results. Experiments showed that our method has higher compression efficiency compared with the conventional method.

AB Nowadays, many individuals and organizations tend to outsource their data to a cloud storage for reducing the burden of data storage and maintenance. However, a cloud provider may be untrustworthy. The cloud thus leads to a numerous security challenges: data availability, data integrity, and data confidentiality. In this paper, we focus on data availability and data integrity because they are the prerequisites of the existence of a cloud system. The approach of this paper is the network coding-based Proof of Retrievability (POR) scheme which allows a client to check whether his/her data stored on the cloud servers are intact. Although many existing network coding-based PORs have been proposed, most of them still incur high costs in data check and data repair, and cannot prevent the small corruption attack which is a common attack in the POR scheme. This paper proposes a new network coding-based POR using the dispersal coding technique, named the ND-POR (Network coding - Dispersal coding POR) to improve the efficiency in data check and data repair and to protect against the small corruption attack.

AB This paper describes an evaluation of a temporally stable spectral envelope estimator proposed in our past research. The past research demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can synthesize speech that is as natural as the input speech. This paper focuses on an objective comparison, in which the proposed algorithm is compared with two modern estimation algorithms in terms of estimation performance and temporal stability. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the others in both aspects.

DE multicore; OLTP; middleware; cache
AB In recent years, dramatic improvements have been made to computer hardware. In particular, the number of cores on a chip has been growing exponentially, enabling an ever-increasing number of processes to be executed in parallel. Having been originally developed for single-core processors, database (DB) management systems (DBMSs) running on multicore processors suffer from cache conflicts as the number of concurrently executing DB processes (DBPs) increases. Therefore, a cache-efficient solution for arranging the execution of concurrent DBPs on multicore platforms would be highly attractive for DBMSs. In this paper, we propose CARIC-DA, middleware for achieving higher performance in DBMSs on multicore processors, by reducing cache misses with a new cache-conscious dispatcher for concurrent queries. CARIC-DA logically range-partitions the dataset into multiple subsets. This enables different processor cores to access different subsets by ensuring that different DBPs are pinned to different cores and by dispatching queries to DBPs according to the data-partitioning information. In this way, CARIC-DA is expected to achieve better performance via a higher cache hit rate for the private cache of each core. It can also balance the loads between cores by changing the range of each subset. Note that CARIC-DA is pure middleware, meaning that it avoids any modification to existing operating systems (OSs) and DBMSs, thereby making it more practical. This is important because the source code for existing DBMSs is large and complex, making it very expensive to modify. We implemented a prototype that uses unmodified existing Linux and PostgreSQL environments, and evaluated the effectiveness of our proposal on three different multicore platforms. The performance evaluation against benchmarks revealed that CARIC-DA achieved improved cache hit rates and higher performance.

AB Fault localization is essential for conducting effective program repair. However, preliminary studies have shown that existing fault localization approaches do not take the requirements of automatic repair into account, and therefore restrict the repair performance. To address this issue, this paper presents the first study on designing fault localization approaches for automatic program repair, that is, we propose a fault localization approach using failure-related contexts in order to improve automatic program repair. The proposed approach first utilizes program slicing technique to construct a failure-related context, then evaluates the suspiciousness of each element in this context, and finally transfers the result of evaluation to automatic program repair techniques for performing repair on faulty programs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective to improve automatic repair performance.

AB Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs for short) are popular dynamic data structures for Boolean functions. In some modern applications, we have to handle such huge graphs that the usual explicit representations by adjacency lists or adjacency matrices are infeasible. To deal with such huge graphs, OBDD-based graph representations and algorithms have been investigated. Although the size of OBDD representations may be large in general, it is known to be small for some special classes of graphs. In this paper, we show upper bounds and lower bounds of the size of OBDDs representing some intersection graphs such as bipartite permutation graphs, biconvex graphs, convex graphs, (2-directional) orthogonal ray graphs, and permutation graphs.

AB In this letter, we propose a new no-reference blur estimation method in the frequency domain. It is based on computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Fourier transform spectrum of the blurred image and analyzing the relationship between its shape and the blur strength. From the analysis, we propose and evaluate six curve-shaped analytic metrics for estimating blur strength. Also, we employ an SVM-based learning scheme to improve the accuracy and robustness of the proposed metrics. In our experiments on Gaussian blurred images, one of the six metrics outperformed the others and the standard deviation values between 0 and 6 could be estimated with an estimation error of 0.31 on average.

TI Dynamic Macro-Based Heuristic Planning through Action Relationship

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE AI planning; heuristic planning; macro; action relationship; dynamic

AB The success of heuristic search in AI planning largely depends on the design of the heuristic. On the other hand, previous experience contains potential domain information that can assist the planning process. In this context, we have studied dynamic macro-based heuristic planning through action relationship analysis. We present an approach for analyzing the action relationship and design an algorithm that learns macros in solved cases. We then propose a dynamic macro-based heuristic that appropriately reuses the macros rather than immediately assigning them to domains. The above ideas are incorporated into a working planning system called Dynamic Macro-based Fast Forward planner. Finally, we evaluate our method in a series of experiments. Our method effectively optimizes planning since it reduces the result length by an average of 10% relative to the FF, in a time-economic manner. The efficiency is especially improved when invoking an action consumes time.

AB Our society has been getting more privacy-sensitive. Diverse information is given by users to information and communications technology (ICT) systems such as IC cards benefiting them. The information is stored as so-called big data, and there is concern over privacy violation. Visual information such as images and videos is also considered privacy-sensitive. The growing deployment of surveillance cameras and social network services has caused a privacy problem of information given from various sensors. To protect privacy of subjects presented in visual information, their face or figure is processed by means of pixelization or blurring. As image analysis technologies have made considerable progress, many attempts to automatically process flexible privacy protection have been made since 2000, and utilization of privacy information under some restrictions has been taken into account in recent years. This paper addresses the recent progress of privacy protection for visual information, showing our research projects: PriSurv, Digital Diorama (DD), and Mobile Privacy Protection (MPP). Furthermore, we discuss Harmonized Information Field (HIFI) for appropriate utilization of protected privacy information in a specific area.

AB This paper proposes to obtain high-level, domain-robust representations for cross-view face recognition. Specially, we introduce Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CDBN) as the feature learning model, and an CDBN based interpolating path between the source and target views is built to model the correlation of cross-view data. The promising results outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper proposes a consistency maintenance scheme for P2P file sharing systems. The basic idea of the proposed scheme is to construct a static tree for each shared file to efficiently propagate the update information to all replica peers. The link to the root of the trees is acquired by referring to a Chord ring which stores the mapping from the set of shared files to the set of tree roots. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by simulation. The simulation result indicates that: 1) it reduces the number of messages in the Li's scheme by 54%, 2) it reduces the propagation delay of the scheme by more than 10%, and 3) the increase of the delay due to peer churns is effectively bounded provided that the percentage of leaving peers is less than 40%.

ID ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an efficient method using Hadoop MapReduce for constructing a K-nearest neighbor graph (K-NNG) from a large-scale data set. K-NNG has been utilized as a data structure for data analysis techniques in various applications. If we are to apply the techniques to a large-scale data set, it is desirable that we develop an efficient K-NNG construction method. We focus on NN-Descent, which is a recently proposed method that efficiently constructs an approximate K-NNG. NN-Descent is implemented on a shared-memory system with OpenMP-based parallelization, and its extension for the Hadoop MapReduce framework is implied for a larger data set such that the shared-memory system is difficult to deal with. However, a simple extension for the Hadoop MapReduce framework is impractical since it requires extremely high system performance because of the high memory consumption and the low data transmission efficiency of MapReduce jobs. The proposed method relaxes the requirement by improving the MapReduce jobs, which employs an appropriate key-value pair format and an efficient sampling strategy. Experiments on large-scale data sets demonstrate that the proposed method both works efficiently and is scalable in terms of a data size, the number of machine nodes, and the graph structural parameter K.

AB A top-k keyword query in relational databases returns k trees of tuples where the tuples containing the query keywords are connected via primary key-foreign key relationships in the order of relevance to the query. Existing works are classified into two categories: 1) the schema-based approach and 2) the schema-free approach. We focus on the former utilizing database schema information for more effective ranking of the query results. Ranking measures used in existing works can be classified into two categories: I) the size of the tree (i.e., the syntactic score) and 2) ranking measures, such as TF-EDF, borrowed from the information retrieval field. However, these measures do not take into account semantic relevancy among relations containing the tuples in the query results. In this paper, we propose a new ranking method that ranks the query results by utilizing semantic relevancy among relations containing the tuples at the schema level. First, we propose a structure of semantically strongly related relations, which we call the strongly related tree (S RT). An SRT is a tree that maximally connects relations based on the lossless join property. Next, we propose a new ranking method, SRT-Rank, that ranks the query results by a new scoring function augmenting existing ones with the concept of the SRT. SRT-Rank is the first research effort that applies semantic relevancy among relations to ranking the results of keyword queries. To show the effectiveness of SRT-Rank, we perform experiments on synthetic and real datasets by augmenting the representative existing methods with SRT-Rank. Experimental results show that, compared with existing methods. SRI-Rank improves performance in terms of four quality measures the mean normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), the number of queries whose top-1 result is relevant to the query, the mean reciprocal rank, and the mean average precision by up to 46.9%, 160.0%, 61.7%, and 63.8%, respectively. In addition, we show that the query performance of SRT-Rank is comparable to or better than those of existing methods.

DE intra prediction; screen content coding; HEVC
AB Screen content generally consists of text, images, and videos variously generated or captured by computers and other electronic devices. For the purpose of coding such screen content, we introduce alternative intra prediction (AIP) modes based on the emerging high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard. With text and graphics, edges are much sharper and a large number of corners exist. These properties make it difficult to predict blocks using a one-directional intra prediction mode. The proposed method provides two-directional prediction by combining the existing vertical and horizontal prediction modes. Experiments show that our AIP modes provide an average BD-rate reduction of 2.8% relative to HEVC for general screen contents, and a 0.04% reduction for natural contents.

AB Recently, video surveillance systems have been widely introduced in various places, and protecting the privacy of objects in the scene has been as important as ensuring security. Masking each moving object with a background subtraction method is an effective technique to protect its privacy. However, the background subtraction method is heavily affected by sunshine change, and a redundant masking by over-extraction is inevitable. Such superfluous masking disturbs the quality of video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a moving object masking method combining background subtraction and machine learning based on Real AdaBoost. This method can reduce the superfluous masking while maintaining the reliability of privacy protection. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves about 78-94% accuracy for classifying superfluous masking regions and moving objects.

AB The label estimation technique provides a new way to design semi-supervised learning algorithms. If the labels of the unlabeled data can be estimated correctly, the semi-supervised methods can he replaced by the corresponding supervised versions. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm, called Geodesic Weighted Sparse Representation (GWSR), to estimate the labels of the unlabeled data. First, the geodesic distance and geodesic weight are calculated. The geodesic weight is utilized to reconstruct the labeled samples. The Euclidean distance between the reconstructed labeled sample and the unlabeled sample equals the geodesic distance between the original labeled sample and the unlabeled sample. Then, the unlabeled samples are sparsely reconstructed and the sparse reconstruction weight is obtained by minimizing the L1-norm. Finally, the sparse reconstruction weight is utilized to estimate the labels of the unlabeled samples. Experiments on synthetic data and USPS handwritten digit database demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI Unsupervised Prosodic Labeling of Speech Synthesis Databases Using
   Context-Dependent HMMs

DT Article
DE speech synthesis; prosodic labeling; hidden Markov model; prosodic
   phrase boundary; emphasis expression
AB In this paper, an automatic and unsupervised method using context-dependent hidden Markov models (CD-HMMs) is proposed for the prosodic labeling of speech synthesis databases. This method consists of three main steps, i.e., initialization, model training and prosodic labeling. The initial prosodic labels are obtained by unsupervised clustering using the acoustic features designed according to the characteristics of the prosodic descriptor to be labeled. Then, CD-HMMs of the spectral parameters, Rh and phone durations are estimated by a means similar to the HMM-based parametric speech synthesis using the initial prosodic labels. These labels are further updated by Viterbi decoding under the maximum likelihood criterion given the acoustic feature sequences and the trained CD-HMMs. The model training and prosodic labeling procedures are conducted iteratively until convergence. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on Mandarin speech synthesis databases and two prosodic descriptors are investigated, i.e., the prosodic phrase boundary and the emphasis expression. In our implementation, the prosodic phrase boundary labels are initialized by clustering the durations of the pauses between every two consecutive prosodic words, and the emphasis expression labels are initialized by examining the differences between the original and the synthetic F0 trajectories. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to label the prosodic phrase boundary positions much more accurately than the text-analysis-based method without requiring any manually labeled training data. The unit selection speech synthesis system constructed using the prosodic phrase boundary labels generated by our proposed method achieves similar performance to that using the manual labels. Furthermore, the unit selection speech synthesis system constructed using the emphasis expression labels generated by our proposed method can convey the emphasis information effectively while maintaining the naturalness of synthetic speech.

AB To better support data-intensive workflows which are typically built out of various independently developed executables, this paper proposes extensions to parallel database systems called User-Defined eXecutables (UDX) and collective queries. UDX facilitates the description of workflows by enabling seamless integrations of external executables into SQL statements without any efforts to write programs confirming to strict specifications of databases. A collective query is an SQL query whose results are distributed to multiple clients and then processed by them in parallel, using arbitrary UDX. It provides efficient parallelization of executables through the data transfer optimization algorithms that distribute query results to multiple clients, taking both communication cost and computational loads into account. We implement this concept in a system called Para Lite, a parallel database system based on a popular lightweight database SQLite. Our experiments show that Para Lite has several times higher performance over Hive for typical SQL tasks and has 10x speedup compared to a commercial DBMS for executables. In addition, this paper studies a real-world text processing workflow and builds it on top of Para Lite, Hadoop, Hive and general files. Our experiences indicate that Para Lite outperforms other systems in both productivity and performance for the workflow.

AB A suffix tree is widely adopted for indexing genome sequences. While supporting highly efficient search, the suffix tree has a few shortcomings such as very large size and very long construction time. In this paper, we propose a very fast parallel algorithm to construct a disk-based suffix tree for human genome sequences. Our algorithm constructs a suffix array for part of the suffixes in the human genome sequence and then converts it into a suffix tree very quickly. It outperformed the previous algorithms by Loh et al. and Barsky et al. by up to 2.09 and 3.04 times, respectively.

AB With the distributed data mining technique having been widely used in a variety of fields, the privacy preserving issue of sensitive data has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Our major concern over privacy preserving in distributed data mining is the accuracy of the data mining results while privacy preserving is ensured. Corresponding to the horizontally partitioned data, this paper presents a new hybrid algorithm for privacy preserving distributed data mining. The main idea of the algorithm is to combine the method of random orthogonal matrix transformation with the proposed secure multi-party protocol of matrix product to achieve zero loss of accuracy in most data mining implementations.

AB For battery based real-time embedded systems, high performance to meet their real-time constraints and energy efficiency to extend battery life are both essential. Real-Time Dynamic Voltage Scaling (RT-DVS) has been a key technique to satisfy both requirements. This paper presents EccEDF (Enhanced ccEDF), an efficient algorithm based on ccEDF. ccEDF is one of the most simple but efficient RT-DVS algorithms. Its simple structure enables it to be easily and intuitively coupled with a real-time operating system without incurring any significant cost. ccEDF, however, overlooks an important factor in calculating the available slacks for reducing the operating frequency. It calculates the saved utilization simply by dividing the slack by the period without considering the time needed to run the task. If the elapsed time is considered, the maximum utilization saved by the stack on completion of the task can be found. The proposed EccEDF can precisely calculate the maximum unused utilization with consideration of the elapsed time while keeping the structural simplicity of ccEDF. Further, we analytically establish the feasibility of EccEDF using the fluid scheduling model. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms ccEDF in all simulations. A simulation shows that EccEDF consumes 27% less energy than ccEDF.

AB A novel standard-compliant multiple description (MD) video codec is proposed in this paper, which aims to achieve effective redundancy allocation using inter- and intra-description correlation. The inter-description correlation at macro block (MB) level is applied to produce side information of different modes which is helpful for better side decoding quality. Furthermore, the intra-description correlation at MB level is exploited to design the adaptive skip mode for higher compression efficiency. The experimental results exhibit a better rate of side and central distortion performance compared with other relevant MDC schemes.

DE web-based application; dynamic data allocation; tabu search algorithm
AB This paper describes a near-optimal allocation method for web-based multi-player online role-playing games (MORPGs), which must be able to cope with a large number of users and high frequency of user requests. Our previous work introduced a dynamic data reallocation method. It uses multiple web servers and divides the entire game world into small blocks. Each ownership of block is allocated to a web server. Additionally, the ownership is reallocated to the other web server according to the user's requests. Furthermore, this block allocation was formulated as a combinational optimization problem. And a simulation based experiment with an exact algorithm showed that our system could achieve 31% better than an ad-hoc approach. However, the exact algorithm takes too much time to solve a problem when the problem size is large. This paper proposes a meta-heuristic approach based on a tabu search to solve a problem quickly. A simulation result shows that our tabu search algorithm can generate solutions, whose average correctness is only 1% different from that of the exact algorithm. In addition, the average calculation time for 50 users on a system with five web servers is about 25.67 msec while the exact algorithm takes about 162 msec. An evaluation for a web-based MORPG system with our tabu search shows that it could achieve 420 users capacity while 320 for our previous system.

AB Most of scientists except computer scientists do not want to make efforts for performance tuning with rewriting their MPI applications. In addition, the number of processing elements which can be used by them is increasing year by year. On large-scale parallel systems, the number of accumulated messages on a message buffer tends to increase in some of their applications. Since searching message queue in MPI is time-consuming, system side scalable acceleration is needed for those systems. In this paper, a support function named LHS (Limited-length Head Separation) is proposed. Its performance in searching message buffer and hardware cost are evaluated. LHS accelerates searching message buffer by means of switching location to store limited-length heads of messages. It uses the effects such as increasing hit rate of cache on host with partial offloading to hardware. Searching speed of message buffer when the order of message reception is different from the receiver's expectation is accelerated 14.3 times with LHS on FPGA-based network interface card (MC) named DIMMnet-2. This absolute performance is 38.5 times higher than that of IBM BlueGene/P although the frequency is 8.5times slower than BlueGene/P. LHS has higher scalability than ALPU in the performance per frequency. Since these results are obtained with partially on loaded linear searching on old Pentium (R) 4, performance gap will increase using state of art CPU. Therefore, LHS is more suitable for larger parallel systems. The discussions for adopting proposed method to state of art processors and systems are also presented.

DE database; multi-dimensional index structure; GPUs
AB Recently, various research efforts have been conducted to develop strategies for accelerating multi-dimensional query processing using the graphics processing units (GPUs). However, well-known multidimensional access methods such as the R-tree, B-tree, and their variants are hardly applicable to GPUs in practice, mainly due to the characteristics of a hierarchical index structure. More specifically, the hierarchical structure not only causes frequent transfers of small volumes of data but also provides limited opportunity to exploit the advanced data parallelism of GPUs. To address these problems, we propose an approach that uses GPUs as a buffer. The main idea is that object entries in recently visited leaf nodes are buffered in the global memory of GPUs and processed by massive parallel threads of the GPUs. Through extensive performance studies, we observed that the proposed approach achieved query performance up to five times higher than that of the original R-tree.

AB Many fatal accidents involving safety-critical reactive systems have occurred in unexpected situations, which were not considered during the design and test phases of system development. To prevent such accidents, reactive systems should be designed to respond appropriately to any request from an environment at any time. Verifying this property during the specification phase reduces the development costs of safety-critical reactive systems. This property of a specification is commonly known as realizability. The complexity of the realizability problem is 2EXPTIME-complete. We have introduced the concept of strong satisfiability, which is a necessary condition for realizability. Many practical unrealizable specifications are also strongly unsatisfiable. In this paper, we show that the complexity of the strong satisfiability problem is EXPSPACE-complete. This means that strong satisfiability offers the advantage of lower complexity for analysis, compared to realizability. Moreover, we show that the strong satisfiability problem remains EXPSPACE-complete even when only formulae with a temporal depth of at most 2 are allowed.

AB In this letter, we present a fast image/video super resolution framework using edge and nonlocal constraint. The proposed method has three steps. First, we improve the initial estimation using content-adaptive bilateral filtering to strengthen edge. Second, the high resolution image is estimated by using classical back projection method. Third, we use joint content-adaptive nonlocal means filtering to get the final result, and self-similarity structures are obtained by the low resolution image. Furthermore, content-adaptive filtering and fast self-similarity search strategy can effectively reduce computation complexity. The experimental results show the proposed method has good performance with low complexity and can be used for real-time environment.

TI Revisiting Shared Cache Contention Problems: A Practical
   Hardware-Software Cooperative Approach

DE multi-core; resource contentions; cache partitioning; application
   scheduling
AB Although shared caches allow the dynamic allocation of limited cache capacity among cores, traditional LRU replacement policies often cannot prevent negative interference among cores. To address the contention problem in shared caches, cache partitioning and application scheduling techniques have been extensively studied. Partitioning explicitly determines cache capacity for each core to maximize the overall throughput. On the other hand, application scheduling by operating systems groups the least interfering applications for each shared cache, when multiple shared caches exist in systems. Although application scheduling can mitigate the contention problem without any extra hardware support, its effect can be limited for some severe contentions. This paper proposes a low cost solution, based on application scheduling with a simple cache insertion control. Instead of using a full hardware-based cache partitioning mechanism, the proposed technique mostly relies on application scheduling. It selectively uses LRU insertion to the shared caches, which can be added with negligible hardware changes from the current commercial processor designs. For the completeness of cache interference evaluation, this paper examines all possible mixes from a set of applications, instead of using a just few selected mixes. The evaluation shows that the proposed technique can mitigate the cache contention problem effectively, close to the ideal scheduling and partitioning.

DE CAN; gateway; busy sequence; worst case response time; the minimum
   distance constraint
AB In modern automobiles, Controller Area Network (CAN) has been widely used in different sub systems that are connected by using gateway. While a gateway is necessary to integrate different electronic sub systems, it brings challenges for the analysis of Worst Case Response Time (WCRT) for CAN messages, which is critical from the safety point of view. In this paper, we first analyzed the challenges for WCRT analysis of messages in gateway-interconnected CANs. Then, based on the existing WCRT analysis method proposed for one single CAN, a new WCRT analysis method that uses two new definitions to analyze the interfering delay of sporadically arriving gateway messages is proposed for non-gateway messages. Furthermore, a division approach, where the end-to-end WCRT analysis of gateway messages is transformed into the similar situation with that of non-gateway messages, is adopted for gateway messages. Finally, the proposed method is extended to include CANs with different bandwidths. The proposed method is proved to be safe, and experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness by comparing it with a full space searching based simulator and applying it to a real message set.

ID MAXIMIZATION
AB We propose a novel threshold-free salient object detection approach which integrates both saliency density and edge response. The salient object with a well-defined boundary can be automatically detected by our approach. Saliency density and edge response maximization is used as the quality function to direct the salient object discovery. The global optimal window containing a salient object is efficiently located through the proposed saliency density and edge response based branch-and-bound search. To extract the salient object with a well-defined boundary, the Grab Cut method is applied, initialized by the located window. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms tilt methods only using saliency or edge response and achieves a comparable performance with the best state-of-the-art method, while being without any threshold or multiple iterations of GrabCut.

AB This paper presents a method for learning an overcomplete, nonnegative dictionary and for obtaining the corresponding coefficients so that a group of nonnegative signals can be sparsely represented by them. This is accomplished by posing the learning as a problem of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with maximization of the incoherence of the dictionary and of the sparsity of coefficients. By incorporating a dictionary-incoherence penalty and a sparsity penalty in the NMF formulation and then adopting a hierarchically alternating optimization strategy, we show that the problem can be cast as two sequential optimal problems of quadratic functions. Each optimal problem can be solved explicitly so that the whole problem can be efficiently solved, which leads to the proposed algorithm, i.e., sparse hierarchical alternating least squares (SHALS). The SHALS algorithm is structured by iteratively solving the two optimal problems, corresponding to the learning process of the dictionary and to the estimating process of the coefficients for reconstructing the signals. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm performs better than the nonnegative K-SVD (NN-KSVD) algorithm and several other famous algorithms, and its computational cost is remarkably lower than the compared algorithms.

ID STRONG COMPUTABILITY; TERMINATION
AB For simply-typed term rewriting systems (STRSs) and higher-order rewrite systems (HRSs) a la Nipkow, we proposed a method for proving termination, namely the static dependency pair method. The method combines the dependency pair method introduced for first-order rewrite systems with the notion of strong computability introduced for typed lambda-calculi. This method analyzes a static recursive structure based on definition dependency. By solving suitable constraints generated by the analysis, we can prove termination. In this paper, we extend the method to rewriting systems for functional programs (RFPs) with product, algebraic data, and ML-polymorphic types. Although the type system in STRSs contains only product and simple types and the type system in HRSs contains only simple types, our RFPs allow product types, type constructors (algebraic data types), and type variables (ML-polymorphic types). Hence, our RFPs are more representative of existing functional programs than STRSs and HRSs. Therefore, our result makes a large contribution to applying theoretical rewriting techniques to actual problems, that is, to proving the termination of existing functional programs.

ID QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT
AB It is the key concern for service providers that how a web service stands out among functionally similar services. QoS is a distinct and decisive factor in service selection among functionally similar services. Therefore, how to design services to meet customers' QoS requirements is an urgent problem for service providers. This paper proposes an approach using QFD (Quality Function Deployment) which is a quality methodology to transfer services' QoS requirements into services' design attribute characteristics. Fuzzy set is utilized to deal with subjective and vague assessments such as importance of QoS properties: TCI (Technical Competitive Index) is defined to compare the technical competitive capacity of a web service with those of other functionally similar services in the aspect of QoS. Optimization solutions of target values of service design attributes is determined by GA (Genetic Algorithm) in order to make the technical performance of the improved service higher than those of any other rival service products with the lowest improvement efforts. Finally, we evaluate candidate improvement solutions on cost-effectiveness. As the output of QFD process, the optimization targets and order of priority of service design attributes can be used as an important basis for developing and improving service products.

AB In this paper, we propose and discuss efficient GPU implementation techniques of absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for a 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic field simulation for antenna design. In view of architectural nature of GPUs, the idea of a periodic boundary condition is introduced to implementation of perfect matched layers (PMLs) as well as a transformation technique of PML equations for partial boundaries. We also present efficient implementation method of a non-uniform grid. The evaluation results with a typical simulation model reveal that our proposed technique almost double the simulation performance and eventually achieve the 55.8% of the peak memory bandwidth of a target GPU.

TI Using Cacheline Reuse Characteristics for Prefetcher Throttling

AB One of the significant issues of processor architecture is to overcome memory latency. Prefetching can greatly improve cache performance, but it has the drawback of cache pollution, unless its aggressiveness is properly set. Several techniques that have been proposed for prefetcher throttling use accuracy as a metric, but their robustness were not sufficient because of the variations in programs' working set sizes and cache capacities. In this study, we revisit prefetcher throttling from the viewpoint of data lifetime. Exploiting the characteristics of cache line reuse, we propose Cache-Convection-Control-based Prefetch Optimization Plus (CCCPO+), which enhances the feedback algorithm of our previous CCCPO. Evaluation results showed that this novel approach achieved a 30% improvement over no prefetching in the geometric mean of the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite with 256 KB LLC, 1.8% over the latest prefetcher throttling, and 0.5% over our previous CCCPO. Moreover, it showed superior stability compared to related works, while lowering the hardware cost.

TI Enhancing Memory-Based Particle Filter with Detection-Based Memory
   Acquisition for Robustness under Severe Occlusion
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE M-PF; visual object tracking; severe occlusion; detection
AB A novel enhancement for the memory-based particle filter is proposed for visual pose tracking under severe occlusions. The enhancement is the addition of a detection-based memory acquisition mechanism. The memory-based particle filter, called M-PF, is a particle filter that predicts prior distributions from past history of target state stored in memory. It can achieve high robustness against abrupt changes in movement direction and quick recovery from target loss due to occlusions. Such high performance requires sufficient past history stored in the memory. Conventionally, M-PF conducts online memory acquisition which assumes simple target dynamics without occlusions for guaranteeing high-quality histories of the target track. The requirement of memory acquisition narrows the coverage of M-PF in practice. In this paper, we propose a new memory acquisition mechanism for M-PF that well supports application in practical conditions including complex dynamics and severe occlusions. The key idea is to use a target detector that can produce additional prior distribution of the target state. We call it M-PFDMA for M-PF with detection-based memory acquisition. The detection-based prior distribution well predicts possible target position/pose even in limited-visibility conditions caused by occlusions. Such better prior distributions contribute to stable estimation of target state, which is then added to memorized data. As a result, M-PFDMA can start with no memory entries but soon achieve stable tracking even in severe conditions. Experiments confirm M-PFDMA's good performance in such conditions.

AB Image warping is usually used to perform real-time geometric transformation of the images captured by the CMOS image sensor of video camera. Several existing look-up table (LUT)-based algorithms achieve real-time performance; however, the size of the LUT is still large, and it has to be stored in off-chip memory. To reduce latency and bandwidth due to the use of off-chip memory, this paper proposes an improved LUT (ILUT) scheme that compresses the LUT to the point that it can be stored in on-chip memory. First, a one-step transformation is adopted instead of using several on-line calculation stages. The memory size of the LUT is then reduced by utilizing the similarity of neighbor coordinates, as well as the symmetric characteristic of video camera images. Moreover, an elaborate pipeline hardware structure, cooperating with a novel 25-point interpolation algorithm, is proposed to accelerate the system and reduce further memory usage. The proposed system is implemented by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based platform. Two different examples show that the proposed ILUT achieves real-time performance with small memory usage and low system requirements.

We combine correlations of orientations, scales and descriptors as a triple feature vector to evaluate each feature pair while low confidence pairs are regarded as outliers and removed. Additionally, all confident pairs are preserved to extract potential symmetries since one feature point may be shared by different pairs. Further, each feature pair forms one cluster and is merged and split iteratively based on the continuity in the Cartesian and concentration in the polar coordinates. Pseudo symmetric axes and outlier midpoints are eliminated during the process. Experiments demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm visually and quantitatively.

DE hand-shape recognition; multi-viewpoint; kernel orthogonal mutual
   subspace method
AB This paper proposes a method for recognizing hand-shapes by using multi-viewpoint image sets. The recognition of a hand-shape is a difficult problem, as appearance of the hand changes largely depending on viewpoint, illumination conditions and individual characteristics. To overcome this problem, we apply the Kernel Orthogonal Mutual Subspace Method (KOMSM) to shift-invariance features obtained from multi-viewpoint images of a hand. When applying KOMSM to hand recognition with a lot of learning images from each class, it is necessary to consider how to run the KOMSM with heavy computational cost due to the kernel trick technique. We propose a new method that can drastically reduce the computational cost of KOMSM by adopting centroids and the number of images belonging to the centroids, which are obtained by using k-means clustering. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluation experiments using multi-viewpoint image sets of 30 classes of hand-shapes.

DE online handwritten character recognition; Lao character recognition;
   Markov random field
AB This paper describes on-line recognition of handwritten Lao characters by adopting Markov random field (MRF). The character set to recognize includes consonants, vowels and tone marks, 52 characters in total. It extracts feature points along the pen-tip trace from pen-down to pen-up, and then sets each feature point from an input pattern as a site and each state from a character class as a label. It recognizes an input pattern by using a linear-chain MRF model to assign labels to the sites of the input pattern. It employs the coordinates of feature points as unary features and the transitions of the coordinates between the neighboring feature points as binary features. An evaluation on the Lao character pattern database demonstrates the robustness of our proposed method with recognition rate of 92.41% and respectable recognition time of less than a second per character.

TI Efficient Tracking of News Topics Based on Chronological Semantic
   Structures in a Large-Scale News Video Archive

DT Article

AB Recent advance in digital storage technology has enabled us to archive a large volume of video data. Thanks to this trend, we have archived more than 1,800 hours of video data from a daily Japanese news show in the last ten years. When considering the effective use of such a large news video archive, we assumed that analysis of its chronological and semantic structure becomes important. We also consider that providing the users with the development of news topics is more important to help their understanding of current affairs, rather than providing a list of relevant news stories as in most of the current news video retrieval systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a structuring method for a news video archive, together with an interface that visualizes the structure, so that users could track the development of news topics according to their interest, efficiently. The proposed news video structure, namely the "topic thread structure", is obtained as a result of an analysis of the chronological and semantic relation between news stories. Meanwhile, the proposed interface, namely "mediaWalker II", allows users to track the development of news topics alone the topic thread structure, and at the same time watch the video footage corresponding to each news story. Analyses on the topic thread structures obtained by applying the proposed method to actual news video footages revealed interesting and comprehensible relations between news topics in the real world. At the same time, analyses on their size quantified the efficiency of tracking a user's topic-of-interest based on the proposed topic thread structure. We consider this as a first step towards facilitating video authoring by users based on existing contents in a large-scale news video archive.

DE fault tolerant control; control reconfiguration; actuator failure;
   system structure; control reallocation
AB In this paper, the problem of control reconfiguration in the presence of actuator failure preserving the nominal controller is addressed. In the actuator failure condition, the processing algorithm of the control signal should be adapted in order to re-achieve the desired performance of the control loop. To do so, the so-called reconfiguration block, is inserted into the control loop to reallocate nominal control signals among the remaining healthy actuators. This block can be either a constant mapping or a dynamical system. In both cases, it should be designed so that the states or output of the system are fully recovered. All these situations are completely analysed in this paper using a novel structural approach leading to some theorems which are supported in each section by appropriate simulations.

TI Feature Location in Source Code by Trace-Based Impact Analysis and
   Information Retrieval
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE feature location; impact analysis; class ranking; information retrieval;
   trace extension
AB Feature location is to identify source code that implements a given feature. It is essential for software maintenance and evolution. A large amount of research, including static analysis, dynamic analysis and the hybrid approaches, has been done on the feature location problems. The existing approaches either need plenty of scenarios or rely on domain experts heavily. This paper proposes a new approach to locate functional feature in source code by combining the change impact analysis and information retrieval. In this approach, the source code is instrumented and executed using a single scenario to obtain the execution trace. The execution trace is extended according to the control flow to cover all the potentially relevant classes. The classes are ranked by trace-based impact analysis and information retrieval. The ranking analysis takes advantages of the semantics and structural characteristics of source code. The identified results are of higher precision than the individual approaches. Finally, two open source cases have been studied and the efficiency of the proposed approach is verified.

AB This paper discusses the task of human action detection. It requires not only classifying what type the action of interest is, but also finding actions' spatial-temporal locations in a video. The novelty of this paper lies on two significant aspects. One is to introduce a new graph based representation for the search space in a video. The other is to propose a novel sub-volume search method by Minimum Cycle detection. The proposed method has a low computation complexity while maintaining a high action detection accuracy. It is evaluated on two challenging datasets which are captured in cluttered backgrounds. The proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in most situations in terms of both Precision-Recall values and running speeds.

DE sparsity preserving embedding; manifold learning; discriminant analysis;

AB In the past few years, discriminant analysis and manifold learning have been widely used in feature extraction. Recently, the sparse representation technique has advanced the development of pattern recognition. In this paper, we combine both discriminant analysis and manifold learning with sparse representation technique and propose a novel feature extraction approach named sparsity preserving embedding with manifold learning and discriminant analysis. It seeks an embedded space, where not only the sparse reconstructive relations among original samples are preserved, but also the manifold and discriminant information of both original sample set and the corresponding reconstructed sample set is maintained. Experimental results on the public AR and FERET face databases show that our approach outperforms relevant methods in recognition performance.

ID UNIVERSALLY COMPOSABLE SECURITY; IDENTIFICATION
AB Due to rapid growth of RFID system applications, the security and privacy problems become more and more important to guarantee the validity of RFID systems. Without introducing proper privacy protection mechanisms, widespread deployment of RFID could raise privacy concerns to both companies and individuals. As a fundamental issue for the design and analysis of secure RFID systems, some formal RFID privacy frameworks were proposed in recent years to give the principles for evaluating the security and privacy in RFID system. However, readers can be confused with so many proposed frameworks. In this paper, we make a comparative and survey study on the proposed RFID privacy frameworks. We mainly divide the existing models into three categories, the four-oracle framework, eight-oracle framework and Universal Composability framework. We give a brief review on the existing models and describe their abilities to model the adversarial behavior in RFID systems. We then analyze relations among those existing RFID privacy models and make some comparisons among their properties.

In 2010, Rasslan and Youssef showed that the Hwang et al.'s authenticated encryption scheme is not secure by presenting a message forgery attack. However, Rasslan and Youssef did not give how to solve the security issue. In this letter, we give an improvement of the Hwang et al.'s scheme. The improved scheme not only solves the security issue of the original scheme, but also maintains its efficiency.

AB We propose a system that, using video information, segments the mouth region from a face image and then detects the protrusion of the tongue from inside the oral cavity. Initially, under the assumption that the mouth is closed, we detect both mouth corners. We use a set of specifically oriented Gabor filters for enhancing horizontal features corresponding to the shadow existing between the upper and lower lips. After applying the Hough line detector, the extremes of the line that was found are regarded as the mouth corners. Detection rate for mouth corner localization is 85.33%. These points are then input to a mouth appearance model which fits a mouth contour to the image. By segmenting its bounding box we obtain a mouth template. Next, considering the symmetric nature of the mouth, we divide the template into right and left halves. Thus, our system makes use of three templates. We track the mouth in the following frames using normalized correlation for mouth template matching. Changes happening in the mouth region are directly described by the correlation value, i.e., the appearance of the tongue in the surface of the mouth will cause a decrease in the correlation coefficient through time. These coefficients are used for detecting the tongue protrusion. The right and left tongue protrusion positions will be detected by analyzing similarity changes between the right and left half-mouth templates and the currently tracked ones. Detection rates under the default parameters of our system are 90.20% for the tongue protrusion regardless of the position, and 84.78% for the right and left tongue protrusion positions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of real-time tongue protrusion detection in vision-based systems and motivates further investigating the usage of this new modality in human-computer communication.

ID IMAGE-RESTORATION
AB In this paper, we propose a spatially adaptive gradient-projection algorithm for the H.264 video coding standard to remove coding artifacts using local statistics. A hybrid method combining a new weighted constrained least squares (WCLS) approach and the projection onto convex sets (POCS) approach is introduced, where weighting components are determined on the basis of the human visual system (HVS) and projection set is defined by the difference between adjacent pixels and the quantization index (QI). A new visual function is defined to determine the weighting matrices controlling the degree of global smoothness, and a projection set is used to obtain a solution satisfying local smoothing constraints, so that the coding artifacts such as blocking and ringing artifacts can be simultaneously removed. The experimental results show the capability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper presents a strategy together with tool support for the translation of state machines from equational theories into rewrite theories, aiming at automatically generating rewrite theory specifications. Duplicate effort can be saved on specifying state machines both in equational theories and rewrite theories, when we incorporate the theorem proving facilities of CafeOBJ with the model checking facilities of Maude. Experimental results show that efficiencies of the generated specifications by the proposed strategy are significantly improved, compared with those that are generated by three other existing translation strategies.

AB Every time-series has its own linear trend, the directionality of a time-series, and removing the linear trend is crucial to get more intuitive matching results. Supporting the linear detrending in subsequence matching is a challenging problem due to the huge number of all possible subsequences. In this paper we define this problem as the linear detrending subsequence matching and propose its efficient index-based solution. To this end, we first present a notion of LD-windows (LD means linear detrending). Using the LD-windows we then present a lower bounding theorem for the index-based matching solution and show its correctness. We next propose the index building and subsequence matching algorithms: We finally show the superiority of the index-based solution.

TI A Compound Parallel Btree for High Scalability and Availability on
   Chained Declustering Parallel Systems
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE parallel Btree; scalability; availability; chained declustering
ID DATA-PLACEMENT; PERFORMANCE
AB Scalability and availability are the key features of parallel database systems. To realize scalability, many dynamic load-balancing methods with data placement and parallel index structures on shared-nothing parallel infrastructure have been proposed. Data migration with range-partitioned placement using a parallel Btree is one solution. The combination of range partitioning and chained declustered replicas provides high availability (HA) while preserving scalability. However, independent treatment of the primary and backup data in each node requires long failover times. We propose a novel method for the compound treatment of chained declustered replicas using a parallel Btree, termed the Fat-Btree. In the proposed method, a single Fat-Btree provides access paths to both the primary and backup data of all processor elements (PEs), which greatly reduces failover time. Moreover, these access paths overlap between two neighboring PEs, which enables dynamic load balancing without physical data migration by dynamically redirecting the access paths. In addition, this compound treatment improves memory space utilization to enable index processing with good scalability. Experiments using PostgreSQL on a 160-node PC cluster demonstrate the effectiveness of the high scalability and availability of our proposed method.

AB The Laplacian support vector machine (LSVM) is a semi-supervised framework that uses manifold regularization for learning from labeled and unlabeled data. However, the optimal kernel parameters of LSVM are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel LSVM (MK-LSVM) method using multi-kernel learning formulations in combination with the LSVM. Our learning formulations assume that a set of base kernels are grouped, and employ l(2) norm regularization for automatically seeking the optimal linear combination of base kernels. Experimental testing reveals that our method achieves better performance than the LSVM alone using synthetic data, the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the Caltech database of Generic Object Classification.

AB Design complexity metrics while measured from the code have shown to be good predictors of fault prone object oriented programs Some of the most often used metrics are the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics (CK) This paper discusses how to make early predictions of fault prone object oriented classes using a UML approximation of three CK metrics First we present a simple approach to approximate Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) Response For Class (RFC) and Coupling Between Objects (CBO) CK metrics using UML collaboration diagrams Then we study the application of two data normalization techniques Such study has a twofold purpose to decrease the error approximation in measuring the mentioned CK metrics from UML diagrams and to obtain a more similar data distribution of these metrics among software projects so that better prediction results are obtained when using the same prediction model across different software projects Finally we construct three prediction models with the source code of a package of an open source software project (Mylyn from Eclipse) and we test them with several other packages and three different small size software projects using their UML and code metrics for comparison The results of our empirical study lead us to conclude that the proposed UML RFC and UML CBO metrics can predict fault proneness of code almost with the same accuracy as their respective code metrics do The elimination of outliers and the normalization procedure used were of great utility not only for enabling our UML metrics to predict fault proneness of code using a code based prediction model but also for improving the prediction results of our models across different software packages and projects.

AB We present a new discriminative method of acoustic model adaptation that deals with a task-dependent speech variability. We have focused on differences of expressions or speaking styles between tasks and set the objective of this method as improving the recognition accuracy of indistinctly pronounced phrases dependent on a speaking style. The adaptation appends subword models for frequently observable variants of subwords in the task. To find the task-dependent variants, low-confidence words are statistically selected from words with higher frequency in the task's adaptation data by using their word lattices. HMM parameters of subword models dependent on the words are discriminatively trained by using linear transforms with a minimum phoneme error (MPE) criterion. For the MPE training, subword accuracy discriminating between the variants and the originals is also investigated. In speech recognition experiments, the proposed adaptation with the subword variants reduced the word error rate by 12.0% relative in a Japanese conversational broadcast task.

DT Article
DE XML; DTD; schema update; document transformation
AB DTDs are continuously updated according to changes in the real world. Let t be an XML document valid against a DTD D, and suppose that D is updated by an update script s. In general, we cannot uniquely "infer" a transformation of t from s, i.e., we cannot uniquely determine the elements in t that should be deleted and/or the positions in t that new elements should be inserted into. In this paper, we consider inferring K optimum transformations of t from s so that a user finds the most desirable transformation more easily. We first show that the problem of inferring K optimum transformations of an XML document from an update script is NP-hard even if K = 1. Then, assuming that an update script is of length one, we show an algorithm for solving the problem, which runs in time polynomial of vertical bar D vertical bar, vertical bar t vertical bar, and K.

AB Reflecting the rapid growth of information technology, the configuration of software applications such as word processors and spread-sheets is both sophisticated and complicated. It is often difficult for users to identify relevant functions in the online manual for a target application. In this paper, we propose a method for question answering that finds functions related to the user's request. To enhance our method, we addressed two "mismatch" problems. The first problem is associated with a mismatch in vocabulary, where the same concept is represented by different words in the manual and in the user's question. The second problem is associated with a mismatch in function. Although the user may have a hypothetical function for a purpose in mind, this purpose can sometimes be accomplished by other functions. To resolve these mismatch problems, we extract terms related to software functions from the Web, so that the user's question can be matched to the relevant function with high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method experimentally.

AB File systems make use of the buffer cache to enhance their performance. Traditionally, part of DRAM, which is volatile memory, is used as the buffer cache. In this paper, we consider the use of of Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) as a write cache for metadata of the file system in embedded systems. NVRAM is a state-of-the-art memory that provides characteristics of both non-volatility and random byte addressability. By employing NVRAM as a write cache for dirty metadata, we retain the same integrity of a file system that always synchronously writes its metadata to storage, while at the same time improving file system performance to the level of a file system that always writes asynchronously. To show quantitative results, we developed an embedded board with NVRAM and modify the VFAT file system provided in Linux 2.6.11 to accommodate the NVRAM write cache. We performed a wide range of experiments on this platform for various synthetic and realistic workloads. The results show that substantial reductions in execution time are possible from an application viewpoint. Another consequence of the write cache is its benefits at the FTL layer, leading to improved wear leveling of Flash memory and increased energy savings, which are important measures in embedded systems. From the real numbers obtained through our experiments, we show that wear leveling is improved considerably and also quantify the improvements in terms of energy.

TI Software Reliability Modeling Considering Fault Correction Process

DT Article
DE software reliability; software testing; fault correction process;

AB Many existing software reliability models (SRMs) are based on the assumption that fault correction activities take a negligible amount of time and resources, which is often invalid in real-life situations. Consequently, the estimated and predicted software reliability tends to be over-optimistic, which could in turn mislead management in related decision-making. In this paper, we first make an in-depth analysis of real-life software testing process; then a Markovian SRM considering fault correction process is proposed. Parameter estimation method and software reliability prediction method are established. A numerical example is given which shows that by using the proposed model and methods. the results obtained tend to be more appropriate and realistic.

AB In this paper, we present a discriminative word-character hybrid model for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. Our word-character hybrid model offers high performance since it can handle both known and unknown words. We describe our strategies that yield good balance for learning the characteristics of known and unknown words and propose an error-driven policy that delivers such balance by acquiring examples of unknown words from particular errors in a training corpus. We describe an efficient framework for training our model based on the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA), evaluate our approach on the Penn Chinese Treebank, and show that it achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature.

AB Quantification of the hip cartilages is clinically important. In this study, we propose an automatic technique for segmentation and visualization of the acetabular and femoral head cartilages based on clinically obtained multi-slice T1-weighted MR data and a hybrid approach. We follow a knowledge based approach by employing several features such as the anatomical shapes of the hip femoral and acetabular cartilages and corresponding image intensities. We estimate the center of the femoral head by a Hough transform and then automatically select the volume of interest. We then automatically segment the hip bones by a self-adaptive vector quantization technique. Next, we localize the articular central line by a modified canny edge detector based on the first and second derivative filters along the radial lines originated from the femoral head center and anatomical constraint. We then roughly segment the acetabular and femoral head cartilages using derivative images obtained in the previous step and a top-hat filter. Final masks of the acetabular and femoral head cartilages are automatically performed by employing the rough results, the estimated articular center line and the anatomical knowledge. Next, we generate a thickness map for each cartilage in the radial direction based on a Euclidian distance. Three dimensional pelvic bones, acetabular and femoral cartilages and corresponding thicknesses are overlaid and visualized. The techniques have been implemented in C++ and MATLAB environment. We have evaluated and clarified the usefulness of the proposed techniques in the presence of 40 clinical hips multi-slice MR images.

IETF has proposed the Mobile IPv6 as the basic mobility management protocol for IPv6 networks. To enhance the performance of the basic MIPv6. researchers have been actively working oil HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 protocols. In this paper, we propose a new mobility management protocol, HIMIPv6 (Highly Integrated MIPv6), which tightly integrates the hierarchical mobility management mechanism of the HMIPv6 and the proactive handover support of the FMIPv6 to enhance the handover performance especially for the cellular networking environment with high frequent handover activities. We have performed extensive simulation study using ns2 and the results show that the proposed HIMIPv6 Outperforms FMIPv6 and HMIPv6. There is no packet loss and consequent service interruption caused by IP handover in HIMIP.

DE Web; User Generated Content (UGC); blog and cryptographic access control
AB Using Web-based content management systems such as Blog, an end user can easily publish User Generated Content (UGC). Although publishing of UGCs is easy, controlling access to them is a difficult problem for end users. Currently. most of Blog sites offer no access control mechanism, and even when it is available to users, it is not sufficient to control users who do not have an account at the site, not to mention that it cannot control accesses to content hosted by other UGC sites. In this paper, we propose new access control architecture for UGC in which third party entities can offer access control mechanism to users independently of UGC hosting sites. With this architecture, a user can control accesses to his content that might be spread over many different UGC sites, regardless of whether those sites have access control mechanism or not. The key idea to separate access control mechanism from UGC sites is to apply cryptographic access control and we implemented the idea in such a way that it requires no modification to UGC sites and Web browsers. Our prototype implementation shows that the proposed access control architecture can be easily deployed in the current Web-based communication environment and it works quite well With Popular Blog sites.

AB Traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms do not consider different semantic significances (weights) of the items. By considering different weights of the items. weighted frequent pattern (WFP) mining becomes an important research issue in data mining and knowledge discovery area. However, the existing state-of-the-art WFP mining algorithms consider all the data from the very beginning of a database to discover the resultant weighted frequent patterns. Therefore. their approaches may not be suitable for the large-scale data environment such its data streams where the volume of data is huge and unbounded. Moreover. they cannot extract the recent change of knowledge in a data stream adaptively by considering the old information which may not be interesting in the current time period. Another major limitation of the existing algorithms is to scan a database multiple fillies for finding the resultant weighted frequent patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale algorithm WFPMDS (Weighted Frequent Pattern Mining over Data Streams) for sliding window-based WFP ruining over data streams. By using a single scan of data stream, the WFPMDS algorithm can discover important knowledge from the recent data elements. Extensive performance analyses show that our proposed algorithm is very efficient for sliding window-based WFP ruining over data streams.

AB A task that suspends itself to wait for an I/O completion or to wait for an event from another node in distributed environments is called an I/O blocking task. Conventional hard real-time scheduling theories use framework of rate monotonic analysis (RMA) to schedule such I/O blocking tasks. However. most of them are pessimistic. In this paper. we propose effective algorithms that can schedule a task set which has I/O blocking tasks tinder dynamic priority assignment. We present a new critical instant theorem for the multi-frame task set under dynamic priority assignment. The schedulability is analyzed tinder the new critical instant theorem. For the schedulability analysis, this paper presents saturation summation which is used to calculate the maximum interference function (MIF). With saturation summation. the schedulability of a task set having I/O blocking tasks can be analyzed more accurately. We propose all algorithm which is called Frame Laxity Monotonic Scheduling (FLMS). A genetic algorithm (GA) is also applied. From Our experiments. we can conclude that FLMS call significantly reduce the calculation time. and GA can improve task schedulability ratio more than is possible with FILMS.

AB With proliferation of smart handsets capable of mobile Internet, the severity of malware attacks targeting such handsets is rapidly increasing, thereby requiring effective countermeasure for them. However, existing signature-based solutions are not suitable for resource-poor handsets due to the excessive run-time overhead of matching against ever-increasing malware pattern database as well as the limitation of detecting well-known malware only. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a bio-inspired approach to discriminate malware (non-self) front normal programs (self) by replicating the processes of biological immune system. Our proposed approach achieves superior performance in terms of detecting 83.7% of new malware or their variants and scalable storage requirement that grows very slowly with inclusion of new malware. making it attractive for use with mobile handsets.

DE H.264; intra prediction; scanning
AB Various scanning algorithms have been proposed to enhance the performance of intra prediction of H.264 codec. In this paper, an adaptive scanning scheme is proposed to achieve the entropy coding gain in intra coding, where scanning patterns are updated based on the probabilistic distribution of quantized coefficients of previous macroblocks so that the consecutive zeros are located at the rear part of the scanned data stream. Simulation results show that the average bit-rate reduction is about 2.15% in common test conditions.

ID 3-STEP SEARCH ALGORITHM; PREDICTION
AB The block based motion estimation technique is adopted by various video coding standards to reduce the temporal redundancy in video sequences. The core of that technique is the search algorithm implemented to find the location of the best matched block. Indeed, the full search algorithm is the most straightforward and optimal but computationally demanding search algorithm. Consequently, many fast and suboptimal search algorithms have been proposed. Reduction of the number of location being searched is the approach used to decrease the computational load of full search. In this paper, hybridization between an adaptive search algorithm and the full search algorithm is proposed. The adaptive search algorithm benefits from the correlation within spatial and temporal adjacent blocks. At the same time, a feature domain based matching criteria is used to reduce the complexity resulting from applying the pixel based conventional criteria. It is shown that the proposed algorithm produces good quality performance and requires less computational time compared with popular block matching algorithms.

AB A new online, unsupervised voice activity detection (VAD) method is proposed. The method is based on a feature derived from high-order statistics (HOS), enhanced by a second metric based on normalized autocorrelation peaks to improve its robustness to non-Gaussian noises. This feature is also oriented for discriminating between close-talk and far-field speech. thus providing a VAD method in the context of human-to-human interaction independent of the energy level. The classification is done by an online variation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. to track and adapt to noise variations in the speech signal. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated on an in-house data and on CENSREC-1-C a publicly available database used for VAD in the context of automatic speech recognition (ASR). On both test sets, the proposed method outperforms a simple energy-based algorithm and is shown to be more robust against the change in speech sparsity. SNR variability and the noise type.

AB Reconfigurable architectures are one of the most promising solutions satisfying both performance and flexibility. However, reconfiguration overhead in those architectures makes them inappropriate for repetitive reconfigurations. In this paper, we introduce a configuration sharing technique to reduce reconfiguration overhead between similar applications using static partial reconfiguration. Compared to the traditional resource sharing that configures multiple temporal partitions simultaneously and employs a time-multiplexing technique, the proposed configuration sharing reconfigures a device incrementally as an application changes and requires a backend adaptation to reuse configurations between applications. Adopting a data-flow intermediate representation, our compiler framework extends a min-cut placer and a negotiation-based router to deal with the configuration sharing. The results report that the framework could reduce 20% of configuration time at the expense of 1.9% of computation time on average.

DE eye tracking; saccade; fixation; N-gram model; entropy
AB In order to investigate reading processes of Japanese language learners, we have conducted an experiment to record eye movements during Japanese text reading using an eye-tracking system. We showed that Japanese native speakers use "forward and backward jumping eye movements" frequently [13], [14]. In this paper, we analyzed further the same eye tracking data. Our goal is to examine whether Japanese learners fix their eye movements at boundaries of linguistic units such as words, phrases or clauses when they start or end "backward jumping". We consider conventional linguistic boundaries as well as boundaries empirically defined based on the entropy of the N-gram model. Another goal is to examine the relation between the entropy of the N-gram model and the depth of syntactic structures of sentences. Our analysis shows that (1) Japanese learners often fix their eyes at linguistic boundaries, (2) the average of the entropy is the greatest at the fifth depth of syntactic structures.

AB In this paper, a new access method is proposed for current positions of moving objects on road networks in order to efficiently update their positions. In the existing index structures, the connectivity of edges is lost because the intersection points in which three or more edges are split. The proposed index structure preserves the network connectivity, which uses intersection oriented network model by not splitting intersection nodes that three or more edges meet for preserving the connectivity of adjacent road segments. The data node stores not only the positions of moving object but also the connectivity of networks.

AB Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is an indicator of osteoporosis that is an increasingly serious disease, particularly for the elderly. To calculate BMD, we need to measure the volume of the femur in a noninvasive way. In this paper, we propose a noninvasive bone volume measurement method using x-ray attenuation on radiography and medical knowledge. The absolute thickness at one reference pixel and the relative thickness at all pixels of the bone in the x-ray image are used to calculate the volume and the BMD. First, the absolute bone thickness of one particular pixel is estimated by the known geometric shape of a specific bone part as medical knowledge. The relative bone thicknesses of all pixels are then calculated by x-ray attenuation of each pixel. Finally, given the absolute bone thickness of the reference pixel, the absolute bone thickness of all pixels is mapped. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments on 300 subjects were performed. We found that the method provides good estimations of real BMD values of femur bone. Estimates shows a high linear correlation of 0.96 between the volume Bone Mineral Density (vBMD) of CT-SCAN and computed vBMD (all P < 0.001). The BMD results reveal 3.23% difference in volume from the BMD of CT SCAN.

DE fault-prone module; prediction; spam filter
AB This paper describes a novel approach for detecting fault-prone modules using a spam filtering technique. Fault-prone module detection in source code is important for the assurance of software quality. Most previous fault-prone detection approaches have been based on using software metrics. Such approaches, however, have difficulties in collecting the metrics and constructing mathematical models based on the metrics. Because of the increase in the need for spam e-mail detection, the spam filtering technique has progressed as a convenient and effective technique for text mining. In our approach, fault-prone modules are detected in such a way that the source code modules are considered text files and are applied to the spam filter directly. To show the applicability of our approach, we conducted experimental applications using source code repositories of Java based open source developments. The result of experiments shows that our approach can correctly predict 78% of actual fault-prone modules as fault-prone.

AB In this paper, we propose a scheme for test data reduction which uses broadcaster along with bit-flipping circuit. The proposed scheme can reduce test data without degrading the fault coverage of ATPG, and without requiring or modifying the arrangement of CUT. We theoretically analyze the test data size by the proposed scheme. The numerical examples obtained by the analysis and experimental results show that our scheme can effectively reduce test data if the care-bit rate is not so much low according to the number of scan chains. We also discuss the hybrid scheme of random-pattern-based flipping and single-input-based flipping.

AB We consider a data set in which each example is an n-dimensional Boolean vector labeled as true or false. A pattern is a co-occurrence of a particular value combination of a given subset of the variables. If a pattern appears frequently in the true examples and infrequently in the false examples, we consider it a good pattern. In this paper, we discuss the problem of determining the data size needed for removing "deceptive" good patterns; in a data set of a small size, many good patterns may appear superficially, simply by chance, independently of the underlying structure. Our hypothesis is that, in order to remove such deceptive good patterns, the data set should contain a greater number of examples than that at which a random data set contains few good patterns. We justify this hypothesis by computational studies. We also derive a theoretical upper bound on the needed data size in view of our hypothesis.

AB This paper proposes an approach to cope with temporal power/ground voltage fluctuation for static timing analysis. The proposed approach replaces temporal noise with an equivalent power/ground voltage. This replacement reduces complexity that comes from the variety in noise waveform shape, and improves compatibility of power/ground noise aware timing analysis with conventional timing analysis framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can compute gate propagation delay considering temporal noise within 10% error in maximum and 0.5% in average.

TI Recognizing reverberant speech based on amplitude and frequency

DT Article
DE speech recognition; temporal feature; tandem approach; multistream
   combination; reverberant speech
AB We have attempted to recognize reverberant speech using a novel speech recognition system that depends on not only the spectral envelope and amplitude modulation but also frequency modulation. Most of the features used by modem speech recognition systems, such as MFCC, PLP. and TRAPS, are derived from the energy envelopes of narrowband signals by discarding the information in the carrier signals. However, some experiments show that apart from the spectral/time envelope and its modulation, the information on the zero-crossing points of the carrier signals also plays a significant role in human speech recognition. In realistic environments. a feature that depends on the limited properties of the signal may easily be corrupted. In order to utilize an automatic speech recognizer in an unknown environment, using the information obtained from other signal properties and combining them is important to minimize the effects of the environment. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze carrier signals that are discarded in most of the speech recognition systems. Our system consists of two nonlinear discriminant analyzers that use multilayer per-ceptrons. One of the nonlinear discriminant analyzers is HATS, which can capture the amplitude modulation of narrowband signals efficiently. The other nonlinear discriminant analyzer is a pseudo-instantaneous frequency analyzer proposed in this paper. This analyzer can capture the frequency modulation of narrowband signals efficiently. The combination of these two analyzers is performed by the method based on the entropy of the feature introduced by Okawa et al. In this paper, in Sect. 2, we first introduce pseudo-instantaneous frequencies to capture a property of the carrier signal. The previous AM analysis method are described in Sect. 3. The proposed system is described in Sect. 4. The experimental setup is presented in Sect. 5. and the results are discussed in Sect. 6. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by continuous digit recognition of reverberant speech. The proposed system exhibits considerable improvement with regard to the MFCC feature extraction system.

DE kernel trees; feature selection; support vector sachines
AB The support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most effective classification techniques in several knowledge discovery and data mining applications. However, a SVM requires the user to set the form of its kernel function and parameters in the function, both of which directly affect to the performance of the classifier. This paper proposes a novel method, named a kernel-tree, the function of which is composed of multiple kernels in the form of a tree structure. The optimal kernel tree structure and its parameters is determined by genetic programming (GP). To perform a fine setting of kernel parameters, the gradient descent method is used. To evaluate the proposed method, benchmark datasets from UCI and dataset of text classification are applied. The result indicates that the method can find a better optimal solution than the grid search and the gradient search.

AB This paper proposes a new method for realizing the web page recommendation system by sharing users' web browse history on an anonymous P2P network. Our scheme creates a user profile, a summary of the user's web browse trends, by analyzing the contents of the web pages browsed. The scheme then provides a P2P network to exchange web browse histories so as to create mutual web page recommendations. The novelty of our method lies in its P2P network formulation; it is formulated in a way so that users having similar user profiles are automatically connected, yet their user profiles are protected from being disclosed to other users. The proposed method intentionally distributes bogus user profiles on the P2P network, while not harming the efficiency of the web browse history sharing process.

AB In this paper, we describe a two-phase method for biomedical named entity recognition consisting of term boundary detection and biomedical category labeling. The term boundary detection can be defined as a task to assign label sequences to a given sentence, and biomedical category labeling can be viewed as a local classification problem which does not need knowledge of the labels of other named entities in a sentence. The advantage of dividing the recognition process into two phases is that we can measure the effectiveness of models at each phase and select separately the appropriate model for each subtask. In order to obtain a better performance in biomedical named entity recognition, we conducted comparative experiments using several learning methods at each phase. Moreover, results by these machine learning based models are refined by rule-based postprocessing. We tested our methods on the JNLPBA 2004 shared task and the GENIA corpus.

   representation; octree
AB A hierarchical representation formed by an octree for a volume ray casting is a well-known data structure to skip over transparent regions requiring little preprocessing and storage. However, it accompanies unnecessary comparison and level shift between octants. We propose a new data structure named half-skewed octree, which is an auxiliary octree to support the conventional octree. In preprocessing step, a half-skewed octree selects eight different child octants in each generation step compared with the conventional octree. During rendering, after comparing an octant of the conventional octree with corresponding octant of the half-skewed octree simultaneously at the same level, a ray chooses one of two octants to jump over transparent regions farther away. By this method, we can reduce unnecessary comparison and level shift between octants. Another problem of a conventional octree structure is that it is difficult to determine a distance from the boundary of a transparent octant to opposite boundary. Although we exploit the previously proposed distance template, we cannot expect the acceleration when a ray direction is almost parallel to the octant's boundary. However, our method can solve it without additional operations because a ray selects one octant to leap farther away. As a result, our approach is much faster than the method using conventional octree while preserving image quality and requiring minimal storage.

AB The purpose of our study is to develop an algorithm that would enable the automated detection of lacunar infarct on T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Automated identification of the lacunar infarct regions is not only useful in assisting radiologists to detect lacunar infarcts as a computer-aided detection (CAD) system but is also beneficial in preventing the occurrence of cerebral apoplexy in highrisk patients. The lacunar infarct regions are classified into the following two types for detection: '' isolated lacunar infarct regions '' and '' lacunar infarct regions adjacent to hyperintensive structures.'' The detection of isolated lacunar infarct regions was based on the multiple-phase binarization (MPB) method. Moreover, to detect lacunar infarct regions adjacent to hyperintensive structures, we used a morphological opening processing and a subtraction technique between images produced using two types of circular structuring elements. Thereafter, candidate regions were selected based on three features - area, circularity, and gravity center. Two methods were applied to the detected candidates for eliminating false positives (FPs). The first method involved eliminating FPs that occurred along the periphery of the brain using the region-growing technique. The second method, the multi-circular regions difference method (MCRDM), was based on the comparison between the mean pixel values in a series of double circles on a T1-weighted image. A training dataset comprising 20 lacunar infarct cases was used to adjust the parameters. In addition, 673 MR images from 80 cases were used for testing the performance of our method; the sensitivity and specificity were 90.1 % and 30.0% with 1.7 Fps per image, respectively. The results indicated that our CAD system for the automatic detection of lacunar infarct on MR images was effective.

AB Business Processes are considered a crucial issue by many enterprises because they are the key to maintain competitiveness. Moreover, business processes are important for software developers, since they can capture from them the necessary requirements for software design and creation. Besides, business process modeling is the center for conducting and improving how the business is operated. Security is important for business performance, but traditionally, it is considered after the business processes definition. Empirical studies show that, at the business process level, customers, end users, and business analysts are able to express their security needs. In this work, we will present a proposal aimed at integrating security requirements through business process modeling. We will summarize our Business Process Modeling Notation extension for modeling secure business process through Business Process Diagrams, and we will apply this approach to a typical health-care business process.

TI Reducing computation time of the rapid unsupervised speaker adaptation
   based on HMM-sufficient statistics
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE HMM-sufficient statistics; unsupervised; rapid adaptation; speech
   recognition
AB In real-time speech recognition applications, there is a need to implement a fast and reliable adaptation algorithm. We propose a method to reduce adaptation time of the rapid unsupervised speaker adaptation based on HMM-Sufficient Statistics. We use only a single arbitrary utterance without transcriptions in selecting the N-best speakers' Sufficient Statistics created offline to provide data for adaptation to a target speaker. Further reduction of N-best implies a reduction in adaptation time. However, it degrades recognition performance due to insufficiency of data needed to robustly adapt the model. Linear interpolation of the global HMM-Sufficient Statistics offsets this negative effect and achieves a 50% reduction in adaptation time without compromising the recognition performance. Furthermore, we compared our method with Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR). Moreover, we tested in office, car, crowd and booth noise environments in 10 dB, 15 dB, 20 dB and 25 dB SNRs.

DE HMM-based speech synthesis; Blizzard Challenge 2005; STRAIGHT; HSMM; GV
AB In January 2005, an open evaluation of corpus-based text-to-speech synthesis systems using common speech datasets, named Blizzard Challenge 2005, was conducted. Nitech group participated in this challenge, entering an HMM-based speech synthesis system called Nitech-HTS 2005. This paper describes the technical details, building processes, and performance of our system. We first give an overview of the basic HMM-based speech synthesis system, and then describe new features integrated into Nitech-HTS 2005 such as STRAIGHT-based vocoding, HSMM-based acoustic modeling, and a speech parameter generation algorithm considering GV. Constructed Nitech-HTS 2005 voices can generate speech waveforms at 0.3 xRT (real-time ratio) on a 1.6 GHz Pentium 4 machine, and footprints of these voices are less than 2 Mbytes. Subjective listening tests showed that the naturalness and intelligibility of the Nitech-HTS 2005 voices were much better than expected.

AB As a result of the growth of sensor-enabled mobile devices, in recent years, users can utilize diverse digital contents everywhere and anytime. However, the interfaces of mobile applications are often unnatural due to limited computational capability, miniaturized input/output controls, and so on. To complement the poor user interface (UI) and fully utilize mobility as feature of mobile devices, we explore possibilities for a new UI of mobile devices. This paper describes the method for recognizing and analyzing a user's continuous action including the user's various gestures and postures. The application example we created is mobile game called AM-Fishing game on mobile devices that employ the accelerometer as the main interaction modality. The demonstration shows the evaluation for the system usability.

AB Network emulation system constructs a virtual network environment which has the characteristics of controllable and repeatable network conditions. This makes it possible to predict the correctness and performance of proposed new technology before deploying to Internet. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the correctness and performance of applications based on the PARNEM, a parallel discrete event network emulator. PARNEM employs a BSP based real-time event scheduling engine, provides flexible interactive mechanism and facilitates legacy network models reuse. PARNEM allows detailed and accurate study of application behavior. Comprehensive case studies covering bottleneck bandwidth measurement and distributed cooperative web caching system demonstrate that network emulation technology opens a wide range of new opportunities for examining the behavior of applications.

AB It is known that any chordal graph can be uniquely decomposed into simplicial components. Based on this fact, it is shown that for a given chordal graph, its automorphism group can be computed in O((c! - n)(O(1))) time, where c denotes the maximum size of simplicial components and n denotes the number of nodes. It is also shown that isomorphism of those chordal graphs can be decided within the same time bound. From the viewpoint of polynomial-time computability, our result strictly strengthens the previous ones respecting the clique number.

DE road extraction; snake; inertia; differential feature
AB In this paper we propose a road object extraction technique based on an active contour model (snake) considering inertia and differential features in a movie. Different energy functions can be applicable to snake in order to use information of various objects and various environments. Using many methods for tracking a moving object, snake can be applied to a scene frame by frame. Initial positions of the control points in a frame can refer to the results in the previous frame. We focus on the inertia that works between object shapes in the previous and present frames. In this research inertia is the tendency of a control point to resist its changes in its state of motion in an image space. We introduce an external energy for snake based on inertia of control points. Internal energy functions based on differential features of road geometry are also introduced to extract straight, circular and S-shaped road segments smoothly. The proposed method is applied to extract road geometry from a movie taken by a camera equipped on the flont of a vehicle. Experimental results indicate the availability of the proposed method which is to extract road geometry smoothly and to improve its robustness.

AB This paper proposes a low power scan test scheme and formulates a problem based on this scheme. In this scheme the flip-flops are grouped into N scan chains. At any time, only one scan chain is active during scan test. Therefore, both average power and peak power are reduced compared with conventional full scan test methodology. This paper also proposes a tabu search-based approach to minimize test application time. In this approach we handle the information during deterministic test efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach drastically reduces both average power and peak power dissipation at a little longer test application time on various benchmark circuits.

LA English
DT Article
DE string database; count estimation; count suffix tree; count q-gram tree
ID TREE
AB To estimate the number of substring matches against string data, count suffix trees, (CS-tree) have been used as a kind of alphanumeric histogram,.,. Although the trees are useful for substring count estimation in short data strings (e.g. name or title), they reveal several drawbacks when the target is changed to extremely long strings. First, it becomes too hard or at least slow to build CS-trees, because their origin, the suffix tree, has memory-bottleneck problem with long strings. Secondly, some of CS-tree-node counts are incorrect due to frequent pruning of nodes. Therefore, we propose the count q-gram tree (CQ-tree) as air alphanumeric histogram for long strings. By adopting q-grams (or length-q substrings), CQ-trees can be created fast and correctly within small available memory. Furthermore, we mathematically provide the lower and upper bounds that the count estimation can reach to. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to present such bounds among research activities to estimate the alphanumeric selectivity. Our experimental study shows that the CQ-tree outperforms the CS-tree in terms of the building time and accuracy.

AB We present a training algorithm to create a neural network (NN) ensemble that performs classification tasks. It employs a competitive decay of hidden nodes in the component NNs as well as a selective deletion of NNs in ensemble, thus named a pruning algorithm for NN ensembles (PNNE). A node cooperation function of hidden nodes in each NN is introduced in order to support the decaying process. The training is based on the negative correlation learning that ensures diversity among the component NNs in ensemble. The less important networks are deleted by a criterion that indicates over-fitting. The PNNE has been tested extensively on a number of standard benchmark problem,; in machine learning, including the Australian credit card assessment, breast cancer, cirlce-in-the-square. diabetes, glass identification, ionosphere, iris identification, and soybean identification problems. The results show that classification performances of NN ensemble produced by the PNNE are better than or competitive to those by the conventional constructive and fixed architecture algorithms. Furthermore, in comparison to the constructive algorithm, NN ensemble produced by the PNNE consists of a smaller number of component NNs, and they are more diverse owing to the uniform training for all component NNs.

DT Article
DE peer-to-peer; bulk file dissemination; perpendicular downloading;
   incentive; game theory
AB Flash bulk files downloading in style of P2P through perpendicular pattern becomes more popular recently. Many peers download different pieces of shared files from the source in parallel. They try to reconstruct complete files by exchanging needed pieces with other downloading peers. The throughput of entire downloading community, as well as the perceived downloading rate of each peer, greatly depends on uploading bandwidth contributed by every individual peer. Unfortunately, without proper built-in incentive mechanism, peers inherently tend to relentlessly download while intentionally limiting their uploading bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a both effective and efficient incentive approach-Reciprocity, which is only based on end-to-end measurement and reaction: a peer caps uploading rate to each of its peers at the rate that is proportional to its downloading rate from that one. It requires no centralized control, or electronic monetary payment, or certification. Preliminary experiments' results reveal that this approach offers favorable performance for cooperative peers, while effectively punishing defective ones.

DE support vector machines; lifting-up; homogeneous hyperplanes
AB Geometrical properties of the lifting-up technique in support vector machines (SVMs) are discussed here. In many applications, an SVM finds the optimal inhomogeneous separating hyperplane in terms of margins while some of the theoretical analyses on SVMs have treated only homogeneous hyperplanes for simplicity. Although they seem equivalent due to the so-called lifting-up technique, they differ in fact and the solution of the homogeneous SVM with lifting-up strongly depends on the parameter of lifting-up. It is also shown that the solution approaches that of the inhomogeneous SVM in the asymptotic case that the parameter goes to infinity.

TI PMPATH: A policy routing system for multihomed end-hosts

AB To achieve profits derived from multihoming, policy routing is supposed to be necessary. For routers' policy routing, some systems and implementations already exist. In addition to routers' operating systems with policy routing functions, IP Filter and iproute2 are useful for policy routing on routers. But they don't suit for policy routing on multihomed end-hosts because of differences on network environments between routers and end-hosts. In contrast with routers' network environments, there are some dynamic changes of network environments with some types of end-hosts. for example, laptop computers. Therefore, another policy routing system is needed for end-hosts' policy routing, which adapts to dynamic changes of network environment. PMPATH (Policy based MultiPATH routing system) is a policy routing system and designed especially for end-hosts uses. PMPATH uses source address selection as network selection, PMPATH can adapt to dynamic changes of network environment. PMPATH's policies for source address selection are defined in form of address block. PMPATH also provides outgoing interface selection. We implemented PMPATH on NetBSD 2.99.15 and tested its performance on multihomed end-hosts. PMPATH implementation works well even if there are changes Of network environment. In this result, it is shown that PMPATH is useful for multihomed end-hosts' policy routing.

DE spatial database; data warehouse; range top-k query; aggregate R-tree
AB A range top-k query returns the topmost k records in the order set by a measure attribute within a specified region of multidimensional data. The range top-k query is a powerful tool for analysis in spatial databases and data warehouse environments. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to answer the query by selectively traversing an aggregate R-tree having MAX as the aggregate values. The algorithm can execute the query by accessing only a small part of the leaf nodes within a query region. Therefore, it shows good query performance regardless of the size of the query region. We suggest an efficient pruning technique for the priority queue, which reduces the cost of handling the priority queue, and also propose an efficient technique for leaf node organization to reduce the number of node accesses to execute the range top-k queries.

AB An accurate audio-visual speech corpus is inevitable for talking-heads research. This paper presents our audio-visual speech corpus collection and proposes a head-movement normalization method and a facial motion generation method. T he audio-visual corpus contains speech data, movie data on faces, and positions and movements of facial organs. The corpus consists of Japanese phoneme-balanced sentences uttered by a female native speaker. An accurate facial capture is realized by using an optical motion-capture system. We captured high-resolution 3D data by arranging many markers on the speaker's face. In addition, we propose a method of acquiring the facial movements and removing head movements by using affine transformation for computing displacements of pure facial organs. Finally, in order to easily create facial animation from this motion data, we propose a technique assigning the captured data to the facial polygon model. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed facial motion generation method and show the relationship between the number of markers and errors.

DE multiple description coding models; local discriminant basis; multiple
   classifier systems
AB In this paper, a source coding model for learning multiple concept descriptions of data is proposed. Our source coding model is based on the concept of transmitting data over multiple channels, called multiple description (MD) coding. In particular, frame expansions have been used in our MID coding models for pattern classification. Using this model, there are several interesting properties within a class of multiple classifier algorithms that share with our proposed scheme. Generalization of the MID view under an extension of local discriminant basis towards the theory of frames allows the formulation of a generalized class of low-complexity learning algorithms applicable to high-dimensional pattern classification. To evaluate this approach, performance results for automatic target recognition (ATR) are presented for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the MSTAR public release data set. From the experimental results, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as conditional Gaussian signal model, Adaboost, and ECOC-SVM.

TI Designing target cost function based on prosody of speech database

AB This research aims to construct a high-quality Japanese TTS (Text-to-Speech) system that has high flexibility in treating prosody. Many TTS systems have implemented a prosody control system but such systems have been fundamentally designed to, output speech with a standard pitch and speech rate. In this study, we employ a unit selection-concatenation method and also introduce an analysis-synthesis process to provide precisely controlled prosody in output speech. Speech quality degrades in proportion to the amount of prosody modification, therefore a target cost for prosody is set to evaluate prosodic difference between target prosody and speech candidates in such a unit selection system. However, the conventional cost ignores the original prosody of speech segments, although it is assumed that the quality deterioration tendency varies in relation to the pitch or speech rate of original speech. In this paper, we propose a novel cost function design based on the prosody of speech segments. First, we recorded nine databases of Japanese speech with different prosodic characteristics. Then with respect to the speech databases, we investigated the relationships between the amount of prosody modification and the perceptual degradation. The results indicate that the tendency of perceptual degradation differs according to the prosodic features of the original speech. On the basis of these results, we propose a new cost function design, which changes a cost function according to the prosody of a speech database. Results of preference testing of synthetic speech show that the proposed cost functions generate speech of higher quality than the conventional method.

AB This paper overviews recent progress in the development of corpus-based spontaneous speech recognition technology. Although speech is in almost any situation spontaneous, recognition of spontaneous speech is an area which has only recently emerged in the field of automatic speech recognition. Broadening the application of speech recognition depends crucially on raising recognition performance for spontaneous speech. For this purpose, it is necessary to build large spontaneous speech corpora for constructing acoustic and language models. This paper focuses on various achievements of a Japanese 5-year national project "Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Processing Technology" that has recently been completed. Because of various spontaneous-speech specific phenomena, such as filled pauses, repairs, hesitations, repetitions and disfluencies, recognition of spontaneous speech requires various new techniques. These new techniques include flexible acoustic modeling, sentence boundary detection, pronunciation modeling, acoustic as well as language model adaptation, and automatic summarization. Particularly automatic summarization including indexing, a process which extracts important and reliable parts of the automatic transcription, is expected to play an important role in building various speech archives, speech-based information retrieval systems, and human-computer dialogue systems.

AB This paper explores how to extend the dependency pair technique for proving termination of higher-order rewrite systems. In the first order case, the termination of term rewriting systems are proved by showing the non-existence of an infinite R-chain of the dependency pairs. However, the termination and the non-existence of an infinite R-chain do not coincide in the higher-order case. We introduce a new notion of dependency forest that characterize infinite reductions and infinite R-chains, and show that the termination property of higher-order rewrite systems R can be checked by showing the non-existence of an infinite R-chain, if R is strongly linear or non-nested.

AB The current scheme of access control judges the legality of each access based on immediate information without considering associate information hidden in a series of accesses. Due to the deficiency, access control systems do not efficiently limit attacks consist of ordinary operations. For trusted operating system developments, we extended RBAC and added negative procedural constraints to refuse those attacks. With the procedural constraints, the access control of trusted operating systems can discriminate attack trials from normal behaviors. This paper shows the specification of the extended concept and model, and presents simple analysis results.

AB nAdaptive routing algorithms a which dynamically select the route of a packet, have been widely studied for interconnection networks in massively parallel computers. An output selection function (OSF). which decides the output channel when some legal channels are free, is essential for an adaptive routing. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient OSF called minimal multiplexed and least-recently-used (MMLRU). The MMLRU selection function has the following simple strategies for distributing the traffic: 1) each router locally grasps the congestion information by the utilization ratio of its own physical channels; 2) it is divided into the two selection steps, the choice from available physical channels and the choice from available virtual channels. The MMLRU selection function can be used on any type of network topology and adaptive routing algorithm. Simulation results show that the MMLRU selection function improves throughput and latency especially when the number of dimension becomes larger or the number of nodes per dimension become larger. key words: output selection function, adaptive routing, virtual channel, interconnection networks, massively parallel computers

TI An effective re-marking scheme for Diffserv AF service through multiple
   domains
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE QoS; Diffserv; assured forwarding; DSCP re-marking
AB AF service class in Diffserv by realizes minimum bandwidth guarantee with the use of differentiated drop precedence property marked on each packet. In the context of a multiple domains environment, however, QoS of individual flow is not always preserved due to the remarking behavior forced at the domain boundaries. Focusing on this point, this paper proposes new packet re-marking schemes that can improve the per-flow QoS of AF service traversing multiple domains. The basic concept of the schemes distinguishes packets re-marked to out-of-profile at the domain boundaries from those already marked as out-of-profile at the time of entering the network. and allows the re-marked packet to recover back to in-of-profile, thus regaining its rightful QoS within the networks. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated through simulation. The results on UDP flows show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for reducing packet losses on the flow through multiple domains and preserving fairness between flows. Simulations on TCP flows show that the proposed schemes improve the throughput of the flows through multiple domains. The proposed scheme is especially effective on the transfer time of short TCP flows such as Web traffic, whose throughput is affected more seriously by a single packet loss due to its flow control mechanisms.

AB This paper proposes several novel hierarchical interconnection networks based on the (3, 3)-graphs, namely folded (3, 3)-networks, root-folded (3, 3)-networks, recursively expanded (3, 3)-networks, and flooded (3, 3)-networks. Just as the hypercubes, CCC, Peterson-based networks, and Heawood-based networks, these hierarchical networks have the following nice properties: regular topology, high scalability, and small diameters. Due to these important properties, these hierarchical networks seem to have the potential as alternatives for the future interconnection structures of multicomputer systems, especially massively parallel processors (MPPs). Furthermore, this paper will present the routing and broadcasting algorithms for these proposed networks to demonstrate that these algorithms are as elegant as the algorithms for hypercubes, CCC, and Petersen- or Heawood-based networks.

   torus; traffic balance
AB We have proposed a speculative selection function for adaptive routing, which uses idle cycles of the network physical links to exchange network information between nodes, thus helps to decide the best selection. Previous study on the mesh network showed that SSR gives message selection flexibility that improves network performance by balancing the network traffic in both global and local scopes. This paper evaluates the speculative selection function on 2D torus network with simulation. The simulation compares the network throughput and latency with various traffic patterns. The visualization graphs show how the speculative selection eliminates hotspots and disperses traffic in the global scope. The simulation results demonstrate that by using speculative selection, the network performance is increased by around 7%. Compared to the mesh network, the torus's version has smaller gain due to the high performance nature of the torus network.

TI Noise post-processing for low bit-rate CELP coders
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE CELP; back-ground noise; post-processing; frame erasure; ITUT
AB This paper presents a newly developed noise postprocessing (NPP) algorithm and the results of several tests demonstrating its subjective performance. This NPP algorithm is designed to improve the subjective performance of low bit-rate code excited linear prediction (CELP) decoding under background noise conditions. The NPP algorithm is based on a stationary noise generator and improves the subjective quality of noisy signal input. A backward adaptive detector defines noisy input signal frames from decoded LSF, energy, and pitch parameters. The noise generator estimates and produces stationary noise signals using past line spectral frequency (LSF) and energy parameters. The stationary noise generator has a frame erasure concealment (FEC) scheme designed for stationary noise signals and therefore improves the speech decoder's robustness for frame erasure under back.-round noise conditions. The algorithm has been applied to the following CELP decoders: 1) a candidate algorithm of the ITU-T 4-kbit/s speech coding standard and 2) existing ITU-T standards. the G.729 and G.723.1 series. In both cases, NPP improved the subjective performance of the baseline decoders. Improvements of approximately 0.25 CMOS (CCR MOS: comparison category rating mean opinion score) and around 0.2-0.8 DMOS (DCR MOS: degradation category rating mean opinion score) were demonstrated in the results of our subjective tests when applied to the 4-kbit/s decoder and G.729/G.723.1 decoders respectively. Other test results show that NPP improves the subjective performance of a G.729 decoder by around 0.45 in DMOS under both error-free and frame-erasure conditions, and a further improvement of around 0.2 DMOS is achieved by the FEC scheme in the noise generator.

AB We compared two edge-blending methods for multiprojection displays, elliptic and rectangular blending, by simulating three common situations: (1) an inaccurately estimated calibration parameter, (2) a worn projector lamp, and (3) a shifted viewpoint. We used a two-level-of-detail display including a high-gain rear-projection screen in the simulation to demonstrate an extreme case. The comparisons showed how strongly inaccurate elements affect a composite besides affecting the appearance itself. A subjective assessment was also carried out to obtain the evaluations of actual users. The simulation results showed that in many cases elliptic blending is more effective than rectangular blending.

DE speech recognition; semi-dynamic network decoding; subnet-work caching;
   tail-sharing algorithm
AB This paper presents a new decoding framework for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition that can handle a static search network dynamically. Generally, a static network decoder can use a search space that is globally optimized in advance, and therefore it can run at high speed during decoding. However, its large memory requirement due to the large network size or the spatial complexity of the optimization algorithm often makes it impractical. Our new one-pass semi-dynamic network decoding scheme aims at incorporating such an optimized search network with memory efficiency, but without losing speed. In this framework, a complete search network is organized on the basis of self-structuring subnetworks and is nearly minimized using a modified tail-sharing algorithm. While the decoder runs, it caches subnetworks needed for decoding in memory, whereas static network decoders keep the complete network in memory. The subnetwork caching model is controlled by two levels of caches; local cache obtained by subnetwork caching operations and global cache obtained by subnetwork preloading operations. The model can also be controlled adaptively by using subnetwork profiling operations. Furthermore, it is made simple and fast with compactly designed self-structuring subnetworks. Experimental results on a 25 k-word Korean broadcast news transcription task show that the semi-dynamic decoder can run almost as fast as an equivalent static network decoder under various memory configurations by using the subnetwork caching model.

ID EASILY TESTABLE REALIZATIONS; TEST SETS; MINIMIZATION
AB The utilization of EXOR gates often decreases the number of gates needed for realizing practical logical networks, and enhances the testability of networks. Therefore, logic synthesis with EXOR gates has been studied. In this paper we propose a new logic representation: an ESPP (EXOR-Sum-of-Pseudoproducts) form based on pseudoproducts. This form provides a new three-level network with EXOR gates. Some functional classes in ESPP forms can be realized with shorter expressions than in conventional forms such as the Sum-of-Products. Since many practical functions have the properties of such classes, the ESPP form is useful for making a compact form. We propose a heuristic minimization algorithm for ESPP, and we demonstrate the compactness of ESPPs by showing our experimental results. We apply our technique to some logic function classes and MCNC benchmark networks. The experimental results show that most ESPP forms have fewer literals than conventional forms.

AB Feature point tracking over a video sequence fails when the points go out of the field of view or behind other objects. In this paper, we extend such interrupted tracking by imposing the constraint that under the affine camera model all feature trajectories should be in an affine space. Our method consists of iterations for optimally extending the trajectories and for optimally estimating the affine space, coupled with an outlier removal process. Using real video images, we demonstrate that our method can restore a sufficient number of trajectories for detailed 3-D reconstruction.

ID PARTITION
AB Comparison of intelligent and random testing in data inputting is still under discussion. Little is also known about testing for the whole software and empirical testing methodology when random testing used. This study research not only for data inputting testing, but also operation of software (called transitions) in order to test the whole GUI software by intelligent and random testing. Methodology of this study is that we attempt to research efficiency of random and intelligent testing by Chinese postman problem. In general, random testing is considered straightforward but not efficient. Chinese postman problem testing is complicated but efficient. The comparison between random and intelligent testing would give further recommendation for software testing methodology.

AB Color histograms are effective for representing color visual features. However, the high dimensionality of feature vectors results in high computational cost. Several transformations, including singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA), have been proposed to reduce the dimensionality. In PCA, the dimensionality reduction is achieved by projecting the data to a subspace which contains most of the variance. As a common observation, the PCA basis function with the lowest frequency accounts for the highest variance. Therefore, the PCA subspace may not be the optimal one to represent the intrinsic features of data. In this paper, we apply independent component analysis (ICA) to extract the features in color histograms. PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality and then ICA is performed on the low-dimensional PCA subspace. The experimental results show that the proposed method (1) significantly reduces the feature dimensions compared with the original color histograms and (2) outperforms other dimension reduction techniques, namely the method based on SVD of quadratic matrix and PCA, in terms of retrieval accuracy.

ID AUTOMATA
AB This paper studies the propagation and crossing of signals in cellular automata whose cells are updated at random times. The signals considered consist of a core part, surrounded by an insulating sheath that is missing at the side of the core that corresponds to the direction into which the signal moves. We study two types of signals: (1) signals by which the sheath at the left and right sides of the core advance first in a propagation step, followed by the core, and (2) signals by which the core advances first, followed by the sheath at its left and right sides. These types naturally arise in, respectively, Moore neighborhood cellular automata with semi-totalistic rules and von Neumann neighborhood cellular automata with symmetric transition rules. The type of a signal has a profound impact on the way signals cross each other, as we show by the construction of one signal of each type. The results we obtained should be of assistance in constructing asynchronous circuits on asynchronous cellular automata.

AB In this paper, we propose a preemptive test scheduling technique (a test can be interrupted and later resumed) for core-based systems with the objective to minimize the test application time. We make use of reconfigurable core test wrappers in order to increase the flexibility in the scheduling process. The advantage with such a wrapper is that it is not limited to a single TAM (test access mechanism) bandwidth (wrapper chain configuration) at each core. We model the scheduling problem as a Bin-packing problem, and we discuss the transformation: number of TAM wires (wrapper-chains) versus test time in combination with preemption, as well as the possibilities and the limitations to achieve an optimal solution in respect to test application time. We have implemented the proposed preemptive test scheduling algorithm, and we have through experiments demonstrated its efficiency.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Simple genetic algorithm (SGA) is a population-based optimization method based on the Darwinian natural selection. The theoretical foundations of SGA are the Schema Theorem and the Building Block Hypothesis. Although SGA does well in many applications as an optimization method, it still does not guarantee the convergence of a global optimum in GA-hard problems and deceptive problems. As an alternative schema, therefore, there is a growing interest in a co-evolutionary system where two populations constantly interact and cooperate each other. In this paper we propose a schema co-evolutionary algorithm (SCEA) and show why the SCEA works better than SGA in terms of an extended schema theorem. The experimental analyses using the Walsh-Schema Transform show that the SCEA works well in GA-hard problems including deceptive problems. key words: simple genetic algorithm (SGA), schema co-evolutionary algorithm (SCEA), schema theorem, building block hypothesis, Walsh-schema transform

AB The explosive growth of the Web contents has led to increasing attention on two major challenges: scalability and high availability of network file system. In this paper, based on our previous reports, we introduced the concept of intermediate file handle to cover the heterogeneity of file system and proposed a new data consistency scheme to reduce the overhead of write request in the reliable network file system. In addition, we also proposed a simple load-sharing mechanism for NFS client to switch to a lightly-load server in order to improve the response time of READ requests. With such an approach, NFS Clients are always active. They issued their requests and waited the corresponding replies. Finally, we analyzed the new data consistency scheme. It shows truly that the scheme is able to improve the performance of our network file system.

ID STAR GRAPH; INTERCONNECTION NETWORK; TREE
AB This paper presents a new interconnection network called bi-rotator graph. It is originated from the rotator graph. The rotator graph has many unidirectional edges and the bi-rotator graph is constructed by making edges of the rotator graph bidirectional. The bidirectional edges can help to reduce the average routing distance and increase the flexibility of applications. Therefore, we propose the bi-rotator graph as an alternative to the rotator graph. In this paper, we will first illustrate how to construct the bi-rotator graph and present the node-to-node routing algorithm. Next, we will propose the algorithm for building Hamiltonian cycle, which demonstrates that the bi-rotator graph is Hamiltonian. Finally, we provide a dilation-one algorithm for embedding arbitrary size of cycle into the bi-rotator graph and show that the bi-rotator graph is Hamiltonian-connected.

AB We consider the classification problem as a problem of approximation of a given training set. This approximation is constructed in a multiresolution framework, and organized in a tree-structure. It allows efficient training and query, both in constant time per training point. The proposed method is efficient for low-dimensional classification and regression estimation problems with large data sets.

AB This paper presents a new reconfigurable hardware paradigm, called evolvable hardware (EHW), and its application to the biomedical engineering problem of an artificial hand controller. Evolvable hardware is based on the idea of combining a reconfigurable hardware device with an artificial intelligence robust search technique called genetic algorithms (GAs) to execute reconfiguration autonomously. The first version of the EHW chip was designed in 1998, and this paper describes the latest improvements to the EHW chip, as well as outlining its architecture and the hardware implementation of the GA operations. Execution speed for genetic operations is shown to be about 38.7 times faster with the hardware implementation than with software program running on an AMD Athlon processor (1.2 GHz). As an application of the EHW chip, this paper introduces a controller for a multi-functional prosthetic-hand, and presents experimental data in which a practical myoelectric pattern classification rate of 97.8% was achieved through the application of the EHW chip.

DE speech synthesis; F0 model; clustering; bunsetsu F0 shape; stochastic

AB One of fundamental issues on the F0 contour is modeling relationship between F0 parameters and linguistic information of a sentence. This paper proposes a stochastic F0 model which probabilistically models the relationship between the F0 contour and the linguistic information. For the application of speech synthesis, an F0 generator selects the most probable F0 contour from candidates given by a probabilistic F0 model. An F0 contour of a Japanese sentence is represented by concatenation of F0 patterns of a Japanese syntactic unit, bunsetsu. A bunsetsu F0 pattern is composed of an F0 average and an F0 shape. The F0 average is independently predicted for each bunsetsu by a quantification theory from linguistic features of the bunsetsu. The most probable sequence of bunsetsu F0 shapes for a sentence is found in the F0 shape database based on a probabilistic measure. The probability that an F0 contour is observed for a sentence is defined by two kinds of probabilities, the F0 shape production and the F0 shape bigram. The latter is a probability of adjacent occurrence of two F0 shapes, which is similar to a word bigram in speech recognition. Several typical bunsetsu F0 shapes are extracted by clustering of training data and stored in the F0 shape database. The probability of the F0 shape production is computed for each bunsetsu based on distribution of values for the linguistic feature in a cluster. The RMS prediction errors of the F0 contour are 0.26[octave].

AB This paper provides an overview on efficient algorithms for multicasting in optical networks supported by Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) with limited wavelength conversion. We classify the multicast problems according to off-line and on-line in both reliable and unreliable networks. In each problem class, we present efficient algorithms for multicast and multiple multicast and show their performance. We also present efficient schemes for dynamic multicast group membership updating. We conclude the paper by showing possible extension of the presented algorithms for QoS provision.

We also propose the automatic ad-justment scheme of spatial and temporal target zones, which maximizes the abnormality measurement of forged videos. Evaluation shows that the proposed scheme provides manifest detection capability against both inter-frame and intra-frame forgeries.

AB In recent years, the applications of deep learning have fa-cilitated the development of green intelligent transportation system (ITS), and carbon dioxide estimation has been one of important issues in green ITS. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide estimation could be modelled as the fuel consumption estimation. Therefore, a clustering-based neural network is proposed to analyze clusters in accordance with fuel consumption behav-iors and obtains the estimated fuel consumption and the estimated carbon dioxide. In experiments, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed method is only 5.61%, and the performance of the proposed method is higher than other methods.

However, due to the limited computational resources carried by the UAV, the exist-ing deep learning-based algorithm needs a large amount of computational resources, which makes it impossible to realize the online detection. More-over, there is no effective online detection system at present. To realize the high-precision online detection of electrical equipment, this paper pro-poses an SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) detection algorithm based on the improved Dual network for the images of insulators and spacers taken by UAVs. The proposed algorithm uses MnasNet and MobileNetv3 to form the Dual network to extract multi-level features, which overcomes the shortcoming of single convolutional network-based backbone for fea-ture extraction. Then the features extracted from the two networks are fused together to obtain the features with high-level semantic information. Fi-nally, the proposed algorithm is tested on the public dataset of the insulator and spacer. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can detect insulators and spacers efficiently. Compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm has the advantages of smaller model size and higher accuracy. The object detection accuracy of the proposed method is up to 95.1%.

AB In recent years, with the aging of society, many kinds of research have been actively conducted to recognize human activity in a home to watch over the elderly. Multiple sensors for activity recognition are used. However, we need to consider privacy when using these sensors. One of the candidates of the sensors that keep privacy is a sound sensor. MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) is widely used as a feature extraction algorithm for voice recognition. However, it is not suitable to apply conventional MFCC to activity recognition by sounds of daily life. We denote "sounds of daily life" as "life sounds" simply in this paper. The reason is that conventional MFCC does not extract well several features of life sounds that appear at high frequencies. This paper proposes the im-proved MFCC and reports the evaluation results of activity recognition by machine learning SVM (Support Vector Machine) using features extracted by improved MFCC.

AB Edge computing, which has been gaining attention in re-cent years, has many advantages, such as reducing the load on the cloud, not being affected by the communication environment, and providing excellent security. Therefore, many researchers have attempted to implement neural networks, which are representative of machine learning in edge computing. Neural networks can be divided into inference and learning parts; however, there has been little research on implementing the learning component in edge computing in contrast to the inference part. This is because learning requires more memory and computation than inference, easily exceeding the limit of resources available for edge computing. To overcome this prob-lem, this research focuses on the optimizer, which is the heart of learning. In this paper, we introduce our new optimizer, hardware-oriented logarith-mic momentum estimation (Holmes), which incorporates new perspectives not found in existing optimizers in terms of characteristics and strengths of hardware. The performance of Holmes was evaluated by comparing it with other optimizers with respect to learning progress and convergence speed. Important aspects of hardware implementation, such as memory and oper-ation requirements are also discussed. The results show that Holmes is a good match for edge computing with relatively low resource requirements and fast learning convergence. Holmes will help create an era in which advanced machine learning can be realized on edge computing.

DE cache side-channel; covert channels; ARM TrustZone
AB The ARM TrustZone architecture, which provides hardware-assisted isolation, is widely adopted in mobile and IoT devices. The security of ARM TrustZone relies on the idea of splitting system-on-chip hardware and software into two worlds, namely normal world and secure world. There are legitimate channels at the hardware level that the normal world and the secure world can use to communicate with each other. To protect these channels from being abused, research efforts were invested on restricting the access to these channels from normal world components. Therefore, only predefined and legitimate normal world components can use cross-world communication channels. In this work, we present a study on data covert channels that can bypass such protection mechanisms and smuggle sensitive information. We first analyze causes of the noise in the covert channel between two worlds. Then, we evaluate the accuracy and bandwidth of covert channels built by our PRIME+COuNT method with one built by PRIME+PROBE method. Our results demonstrate that PRIME+COuNT is an effective technique for enabling cross-world covert channels in the ARM TrustZone.

TI Aggregate Signature Schemes with Traceability of Devices Dynamically

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE sensor networks; aggregate signature schemes; fault-tolerant aggregate
   signature schemes; dynamic traitor tracing
AB Aggregate signature schemes enable us to aggregate mul-tiple signatures into a single short signature. One of its typical applications is sensor networks, where a large number of users and devices measure their environments, create signatures to ensure the integrity of the measure-ments, and transmit their signed data. However, if an invalid signature is mixed into aggregation, the aggregate signature becomes invalid, thus if an aggregate signature is invalid, it is necessary to identify the invalid signa-ture. Furthermore, we need to deal with a situation where an invalid sensor generates invalid signatures probabilistically. In this paper, we introduce a model of aggregate signature schemes with interactive tracing function-ality that captures such a situation, and define its functional and security requirements and propose aggregate signature schemes that can identify all rogue sensors. More concretely, based on the idea of Dynamic Traitor Tracing, we can trace rogue sensors dynamically and incrementally, and eventually identify all rogue sensors of generating invalid signatures even if the rogue sensors adaptively collude. In addition, the efficiency of our proposed method is also sufficiently practical.

AB Zero-shot slot filling is a domain adaptation approach to handle unseen slots in new domains without training instances. Previous studies implemented zero-shot slot filling by predicting both slot entities and slot types. Because of the lack of knowledge about new domains, the existing methods often fail to predict slot entities for new domains as well as cannot effectively predict unseen slot types even when slot entities are correctly identified. Moreover, for some seen slot types, those methods may suffer from the domain shift problem, because the unseen context in new domains may change the explanations of the slots. In this study, we propose intrinsic representations to alleviate the domain shift problems above. Specifically, we propose a multi-relation-based representation to capture both the general and specific characteristics of slot entities, and an ontology-based representation to provide complementary knowledge on the relationships between slots and values across domains, for handling both unseen slot types and unseen contexts. We constructed a two-step pipeline model using the proposed representations to solve the domain shift problem. Experimental results in terms of the F1 score on three large datasets- Snips, SGD, and MultiWOZ 2.3-showed that our model outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 29.62, 10.38, and 3.89, respectively. The detailed analysis with the average slot F1 score showed that our model improved the prediction by 25.82 for unseen slot types and by 10.51 for seen slot types. The results demonstrated that the proposed intrinsic representations can effectively alleviate the domain shift problem for both unseen slot types and seen slot types with unseen contexts.

AB A neural conversational model (NCM) based on an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention mech-anism learns different sequence-to-sequence mappings from what neural machine translation (NMT) learns even when based on the same technique. In the NCM, we confirmed that target-word-to-source-word mappings cap-tured by the attention mechanism are not as clear and stationary as those for NMT. Considering that vector norms indicate a magnitude of information in the processing, we analyzed the inner workings of an encoder-decoder GRU-based NCM focusing on the norms of word embedding vectors and hidden vectors. First, we conducted correlation analyses on the norms of word embedding vectors with frequencies in the training set and with con-ditional entropies of a bi-gram language model to understand what is cor-related with the norms in the encoder and decoder. Second, we conducted correlation analyses on norms of change in the hidden vector of the recur-rent layer with their input vectors for the encoder and decoder, respectively. These analyses were done to understand how the magnitude of information propagates through the network. The analytical results suggested that the norms of the word embedding vectors are associated with their semantic in-formation in the encoder, while those are associated with the predictability as a language model in the decoder. The analytical results further revealed how the norms propagate through the recurrent layer in the encoder and decoder.

DE source code search; normalized compression distance
AB Software developers may write a number of similar source code fragments including the same mistake in software products. To remove such faulty code fragments, developers inspect code clones if they found a bug in their code. While various code clone detection methods have been proposed to identify clones of either code blocks or functions, those tools do not always fit the code inspection task because a faulty code fragment may be much smaller than code blocks, e.g. a single line of code. To enable developers to search code clones of such a small faulty code fragment in a large-scale software product, we propose a method using Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance, which is an approximation of Normalized Compression Distance. We conducted an experiment using an existing research dataset and a user survey in a company. The result shows our method efficiently reports cloned faulty code fragments and the performance is acceptable for software developers.

AB Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has made extraordinary progress in image classification tasks. However, it is less effective to use CNN directly to detect image manipulation. To address this problem, we propose an image filtering layer and a multi-scale feature fusion module which can guide the model more accurately and effectively to perform image manipulation detection. Through a series of experiments, it is shown that our model achieves improvements on image manipulation detection compared with the previous researches.

AB It has become common practice for software projects to adopt third-party dependencies. Developers are encouraged to update any outdated dependency to remain safe from potential threats of vulnerabilities. In this study, we present an approach to aid developers show whether or not a vulnerable code is reachable for JavaScript projects. Our prototype, SojiTantei, is evaluated in two ways (i) the accuracy when compared to a manual approach and (ii) a larger-scale analysis of 780 clients from 78 security vulnerability cases. The first evaluation shows that SojiTantei has a high accuracy of 83.3%, with a speed of less than a second analysis per client. The second evaluation reveals that 68 out of the studied 78 vulnerabilities reported having at least one clean client. The study proves that automation is promising with the potential for further improvement.

ID DIGITAL WATERMARKING TECHNIQUE
AB Data hiding techniques are usually applied into digital watermarking or digital fingerprinting, which is used to protect intellectual property rights or to avoid illegal copies of the original works. It has been pointed out that data hiding can be utilized as a communication medium. In conventional digital watermarking frameworks, it is required that the difference between the cover objects and the stego objects are quite small, such that the difference cannot be recognized by human sensory systems. On the other hand, the authors have proposed a 'hearable' data hiding technique for audio signals that can carry secret messages and can be naturally recognized as a musical piece by human ears. In this study, we extend the idea of the hearable data hiding into video signals by utilizing the visual effects. As visual effects, we employ fade-in and fade-out effects which can be used as a kind of visual rendering for scene transitions. In the proposed schemes, secret messages are generated as one-dimensional barcodes which are used for fade-in or fade-out effects. The present paper shows that the proposed schemes have the high accuracy in extracting the embedded messages even from the video signals captured by smartphones or tablets. It is also shown that the video signals conveying the embedded messages can be naturally recognized by human visual systems through subjective evaluation experiments.

TI Firewall Traversal Method by Pseudo-TCP Encapsulation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE QUIC; encapsulation
AB A wide range of communication protocols has recently been developed to address service diversification. At the same time, firewalls (FWs) are installed at the boundaries between internal networks, such as those owned by companies and homes, and the Internet. In general, FWs are configured as whitelists and release only the port corresponding to the service to be used and block communication from other ports. In a previous study, we proposed a method for traversing a FW and enabling communication by inserting a pseudo-transmission control protocol (TCP) header imitating HTTPS into a packet, which normally would be blocked by the FW. In that study, we confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method via its implementation and experiments. Even though common encapsulating techniques work on end-nodes, the previous implementation worked on the relay node assuming a router. Further, middleboxes, which overwrite L3 and L4 headers on the Internet, need to be taken into consideration. Accordingly, we re-implemented the proposed method into an end-node and added a feature countering a typical middlebox, i.e., NAPT, into our implementation. In this paper, we describe the functional confirmation and performance evaluations of both versions of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful deep neural network for natural image dehazing. The proposed method is designed based on U-Net architecture and we made some design changes to make it better. We first use Group Normalization to replace Batch Normalization to solve the problem of insufficient batch size due to hardware limitations. Second, we introduce FReLU activation into the U-Net block, which can achieve capturing complicated visual layouts with regular convolutions. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified components. On the SOTS Indoor and Outdoor datasets, it obtains PSNR of 32.23 and 31.64 respectively, which are comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available online soon.

First, a wireless carbon sensor network is created, the gross error data in the original dataset are eliminated, and remaining valid data are combined with kriging method to generate a series of continuous surfaces for expressing specific features and providing unified spatio-temporally normalized data for subsequent prediction models. Then, the long short-term memory network is used to process these continuous time- and space-normalized data to obtain the carbon dioxide concentration prediction model at any scales. Finally, the experimental results illustrate that the proposed method with spatio-temporal features is more accurate than the single sensor monitoring method without spatio-temporal features.

AB The phenomenon where a speaker mixes two or more languages within the same conversation is called code-switching (CS). Handling CS is challenging for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) because it requires coping with multilingual input. Although CS text or speech may be found in social media, the datasets of CS speech and corresponding CS transcriptions are hard to obtain even though they are required for supervised training. This work adopts a deep learning-based machine speech chain to train CS ASR and CS TTS with each other with semisupervised learning. After supervised learning with monolingual data, the machine speech chain is then carried out with unsupervised learning of either the CS text or speech. The results show that the machine speech chain trains ASR and TTS together and improves performance without requiring the pair of CS speech and corresponding CS text. We also integrate language embedding and language identification into the CS machine speech chain in order to handle CS better by giving language information. We demonstrate that our proposed approach can improve the performance on both a single CS language pair and multiple CS language pairs, including the unknown CS excluded from training data.

AB We investigate an online problem of a robot exploring the outer boundary of an unknown simple polygon P. The robot starts from a specified vertex s and walks an exploration tour outside P. It has to see all points of the polygon's outer boundary and to return to the start. We provide lower and upper bounds on the ratio of the distance traveled by the robot in comparison to the length of the shortest path. We consider P in two scenarios: convex polygon and concave polygon. For the first scenario, we prove a lower bound of 5 and propose a 23.78-competitive strategy. For the second scenario, we prove a lower bound of 5.03 and propose a 26.5-competitive strategy.

AB The progress of immersive technology enables researchers and developers to construct work spaces that are freed from real-world constraints. This has motivated us to investigate the role of the human body. In this research, we examine human cognitive behaviors in obtaining an understanding of the width of their virtual body through simple yet meaningful experiments using virtual reality (VR). In the experiments, participants were modeled as an invisible board, and a spherical object was thrown at the participants to provide information for exploring the width of their invisible body. Audio and visual feedback were provided when the object came into contact with the board (body). We first explored how precisely the participants perceived the virtual body width. Next, we examined how the body perception was generated and changed as the trial proceeded when the participants tried to move right or left actively for the avoidance of collision with approaching objects. The results of the experiments indicated that the participants could become successful in avoiding collision within a limited number of trials (14 at most) under the experimental conditions. It was also found that they postponed deciding how much they should move at the beginning and then started taking evasive action earlier as they become aware of the virtual body.

AB With the development and spread of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, various kinds of data are now being generated from IoT devices. Some data generated from IoT devices depend on geographical location and time, and we refer to them as spatio-temporal data (STD). Since the "locally produced and consumed" paradigm of STD use is effective for location-dependent applications, the authors have previously proposed a vehicle-based STD retention system. However, in low vehicle density environments, the data retention becomes difficult due to the decrease in the number of data transmissions in this method. In this paper, we propose a new data transmission control method for data retention in the low vehicle density environments.

TI Mapping Induced Subgraph Isomorphism Problems to Ising Models and Its

AB Ising machines have attracted attention as they are expected to solve combinatorial optimization problems at high speed with Ising models corresponding to those problems. An induced subgraph isomorphism problem is one of the decision problems, which determines whether a specific graph structure is included in a whole graph or not. The problem can be represented by equality constraints in the words of combinatorial optimization problem. By using the penalty functions corresponding to the equality constraints, we can utilize an Ising machine to the induced subgraph isomorphism problem. The induced subgraph isomorphism problem can be seen in many practical problems, for example, finding out a particular malicious circuit in a device or particular network structure of chemical bonds in a compound. However, due to the limitation of the number of spin variables in the current Ising machines, reducing the number of spin variables is a major concern. Here, we propose an efficient Ising model mapping method to solve the induced subgraph isomorphism problem by Ising machines. Our proposed method theoretically solves the induced subgraph isomorphism problem. Furthermore, the number of spin variables in the Ising model generated by our proposed method is theoretically smaller than that of the conventional method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully solve the induced subgraph isomorphism problem by using the Ising-model based simulated annealing and a real Ising machine.

DE image retrieval; locality sensitive hashing; maximum inner product
   search; high-dimensional spaces
AB Maximum inner product search (MIPS) problem has gained much attention in a wide range of applications. In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces, most of existing methods first transform the MIPS problem into another approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) problem and then solve it by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). However, due to the error incurred by the transmission and incomprehensive search strategies, these methods suffer from low precision and have loose probability guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel search method named Adaptive-LSH (AdaLSH) to solve MIPS problem more efficiently and more precisely. AdaLSH examines objects in the descending order of both norms and (the probably correctly estimated) cosine angles with a query object in support of LSH with extendable windows. Such extendable windows bring not only efficiency in searching but also the probability guarantee of finding exact or approximate MIP objects. AdaLSH gives a better probability guarantee of success than those in conventional algorithms, bringing less running times on various datasets compared with them. In addition, AdaLSH can even support exact MIPS with probability guarantee.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In recent years, the use of big data has attracted more attention, and many techniques for data analysis have been proposed. Big data analysis is difficult, however, because such data varies greatly in its regularity. Heterogeneous mixture machine learning is one algorithm for analyzing such data efficiently. In this study, we propose online heterogeneous learning based on an online EM algorithm. Experiments show that this algorithm has higher learning accuracy than that of a conventional method and is practical. The online learning approach will make this algorithm useful in the field of data analysis.
