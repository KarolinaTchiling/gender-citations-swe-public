DE Automotive Ethernet; SOME/IP; intrusion detection system
AB With the development of in-vehicle network technologies, Automotive Ethernet is being applied to modern vehicles. Scalable service -Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP) is an automotive middleware solution that is used for communications of the infotainment domain as well as that of other domains in the vehicle. However, since SOME/IP lacks security, it is vulnerable to a variety of network-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new type of intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging on SOME/IP packet's header information and packet reception time to deal with SOME/IP related network attacks.

TI Practical Order-Revealing Encryption with Short Ciphertext
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE security; data privacy; order-revealing encryption
AB To support secure database management, a number of value-added encryption schemes have been studied including order -revealing encryption (ORE) schemes. One of outstanding features of ORE schemes is the efficiency of range queries in an encrypted form. Compared to existing encryption methods, ORE leads to an increase in the length of ci-phertexts. To improve the efficiency of ORE schemes in terms of the length of ciphertext, a new ORE scheme with shorter ciphertext has been pro-posed by Kim. In this paper, we revisit Kim's ORE scheme and show that the length of ciphertexts is not as short as analyzed in their paper. We also introduce a simple modification reducing the memory requirement than ex-isting ORE schemes.

TI MP-BERT4REC: Recommending Multiple Positive Citations for Academic

ID COCITATION
AB Considering the rapidly increasing number of academic papers, searching for and citing appropriate references has become a non -trivial task during manuscript composition. Recommending a handful of candidate papers to a working draft could ease the burden of the authors. Conventional approaches to citation recommendation generally consider recommending one ground-truth citation from an input manuscript for a query context. However, it is common for a given context to be sup -ported by two or more co-citation pairs. Here, we propose a novel scien-tific paper modelling for citation recommendations, namely Multi-Positive BERT Model for Citation Recommendation (MP-BERT4REC), complied with a series of Multi-Positive Triplet objectives to recommend multiple positive citations for a query context. The proposed approach has the fol-lowing advantages: First, the proposed multi-positive objectives are ef-fective in recommending multiple positive candidates. Second, we adopt noise distributions on the basis of historical co-citation frequencies; thus, MP-BERT4REC is not only effective in recommending high-frequency co-citation pairs, but it also significantly improves the performance of retriev-ing low-frequency ones. Third, the proposed dynamic context sampling strategy captures macroscopic citing intents from a manuscript and em-powers the citation embeddings to be content-dependent, which allows the algorithm to further improve performance. Single and multiple positive recommendation experiments confirmed that MP-BERT4REC delivers sig-nificant improvements over current methods. It also effectively retrieves the full list of co-citations and historically low-frequency pairs better than prior works. engines using that search propriately studies cited cles and richer methods ies citation intent ding tents cate may possess

AB Cryptocurrency abuse has become a critical problem. Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, criminals commonly adopt cryptocurrency for trading drugs and deceiving people without revealing their identities. Despite its significance and severity, only few works have studied how cryptocurrency has been abused in the real world, and they only provide some limited measurement results. Thus, to provide a more in-depth understanding on the cryptocurrency abuse cases, we present a large-scale analysis on various Bitcoin abuse types using 200,507 realworld reports collected by victims from 214 countries. We scrutinize observable abuse trends, which are closely related to real-world incidents, to understand the causality of the abuses. Furthermore, we investigate the semantics of various cryptocurrency abuse types to show that several abuse types overlap in meaning and to provide valuable insight into the public dataset. In addition, we delve into abuse channels to identify which widely-known platforms can be maliciously deployed by abusers following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Consequently, we demonstrate the polarization property of Bitcoin addresses practically utilized on transactions, and confirm the possible usage of public report data for providing clues to track cyber threats. We expect that this research on Bitcoin abuse can empirically reach victims more effectively than cybercrime, which is subject to professional investigation.

AB As the basis of fine breeding management and animal husbandry insurance, individual recognition of dairy cattle is an important issue in the animal husbandry management field. Due to the limitations of the traditional method of cow identification, such as being easy to drop and falsify, it can no longer meet the needs of modern intelligent pasture management. In recent years, with the rise of computer vision technology, deep learning has developed rapidly in the field of face recognition. The recognition accuracy has surpassed the level of human face recognition and has been widely used in the production environment. However, research on the facial recognition of large livestock, such as dairy cattle, needs to be developed and improved. According to the idea of a residual network, an improved convolutional neural network (Res_5_2Net) method for individual dairy cow recognition is proposed based on dairy cow facial images in this letter. The recognition accuracy on our self-built cow face database (3012 training sets, 1536 test sets) can reach 94.53%. The experimental results show that the efficiency of identification of dairy cows is effectively improved.

DE dialogue system; robot-robot interaction
AB In this study, we generate dialogue contents in which two systems discuss their distress with each other. The user inputs sentences that include environment and feelings of distress. The system generates the dialogue content from the input. In this study, we created dialogue data about distress in order to generate them using deep learning. The generative model fine-tunes the GPT of the pre-trained model using the Transfer-Transfo method. The contribution of this study is the creation of a conversational dataset using publicly available data. This study used Empathetic Dialogues, an existing empathetic dialogue dataset, and Reddit r/offmychest, a public data set of distress. The models fine-tuned with each data were evaluated both automatically (such as by the BLEU and ROUGE scores) and manually (such as by relevance and empathy) by human assessors.

   singular value decomposition
AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify images of unseen classes by learning relationship between visual and semantic features. Existing works have been improving recognition accuracy from various approaches, but they employ computationally intensive algorithms that require iterative optimization. In this work, we revisit the primary approach of the pattern recognition, i.e., nearest neighbor classifiers, to solve the ZSL task by an extremely simple and fast way, called SimpleZSL. Our algorithm consists of the following three simple techniques: (1) just averaging feature vectors to obtain visual prototypes of seen classes, (2) calculating a pseudo-inverse matrix via singular value decomposition to generate visual features of unseen classes, and (3) inferring unseen classes by a nearest neighbor classifier in which cosine similarity is used to measure distance between feature vectors. Through the experiments on common datasets, the proposed method achieves good recognition accuracy with drastically small computational costs. The execution time of the proposed method on a single CPU is more than 100 times faster than those of the GPU implementations of the existing methods with comparable accuracies.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In infrastructure-as-a-service platforms, cloud users can adjust their database (DB) service scale to dynamic workloads by changing the number of virtual machines running a DB management system (DBMS), called DBMS instances. Replicating a DBMS instance is a nontrivial task since DBMS replication is time-consuming due to the trend that cloud vendors offer high-spec DBMS instances. This paper presents BalenaDB, which performs urgent DBMS replication for handling sudden workload increases. Unlike convectional replication schemes that implicitly assume DBMS replicas are generated on remote machines, BalenaDB generates a warmed-up DBMS replica on an instance running on the local machine where the master DBMS instance runs, by leveraging the master DBMS resources. We prototyped BalenaDB on MySQL 5.6.21, Linux 3.17.2, and Xen 4.4.1. The experimental results show that the time for generating the warmed-up DBMS replica instance on BalenaDB is up to 30x shorter than an existing DBMS instance replication scheme, achieving significantly efficient memory utilization.

DE package managers; npm; Stack Overflow
AB Third-party package usage has become a common practice in contemporary software development. Developers often face different challenges, including choosing the right libraries, installing errors, discrepancies, setting up the environment, and building failures during software development. The risks of maintaining a third-party package are well known, but it is unclear how information from Stack Overflow (SO) can be useful. This paper performed an empirical study to explore npm package co-usage examples from SO. From over 30,000 SO question posts, we extracted 2,100 posts with package usage information and matched them against the 217,934 npm library package. We find that, popular and highly used libraries are not discussed as often in SO. However, we can see that the accepted answers may prove useful, as we believe that the usage examples and executable commands could be reused for tool support.

ID EFFICIENT ALGORITHM
AB FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based accelerators are attracting significant interest in cloud computing systems. Combining multi-FPGA systems with cloud computing brings a new perspective to the reconfigurable computing research. However, the multi-tenancy of a multi-FPGA system has not been fully discussed in the previous researches. In this paper, we propose a multi-tenant resource management system, named FiC-RM, for a multi-FPGA cloud system. FiC-RM provides users with a set of FPGA resources according to their requirements and allows them to exclusively access FPGA boards and the interconnection network. To achieve this, we propose a placement algorithm which is a key to efficiently share the limited resources. We demonstrate FiC-RM controls a practical scale multi-FPGA system. Moreover, Our simulation study shows that our placement algorithm achieved 3 to 4% improvement in the average resource usage and a 20-second reduction in the response time, compared to other existing naive algorithms.

TI A Fast Algorithm for Liquid Voting on Blockchain
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE liquid voting; blockchain; smart contract; gas limit; Merkle tree
AB Blockchain-based voting, including liquid voting, has been extensively studied in recent years. However, it remains challenging to implement liquid voting on blockchain using Ethereum smart contract. The challenge comes from the gas limit, which is that the number of instructions for processing a ballot cannot exceed a certain amount. This restricts the application scenario with respect to algorithms whose time complexity is linear to the number of voters, i.e., O(n). As the blockchain technology can well share and reuse the resources, we study a model of liquid voting on blockchain and propose a fast algorithm, named Flash, to eliminate the restriction. The key idea behind our algorithm is to shift some on-chain process to off-chain. In detail, we first construct a Merkle tree off-chain which contains all voters' properties. Second, we use Merkle proof and interval tree to process each ballot with O(log n) on-chain time complexity. Theoretically, the algorithm can support up to 21000 voters with respect to the current gas limit on Ethereum. Experimentally, the result implies that the consumed gas fee remains at a very low level when the number of voters increases. This means our algorithm makes liquid voting on blockchain practical even for massive voters.

AB Loading test vectors and unloading test responses in shift mode during scan testing cause many scan flip-flops to switch simultaneously. The resulting shift switching activity around scan flip-flops can cause excessive local IR-drop that can change the states of some scan flip-flops, leading to test data corruption. A common approach solving this problem is partial-shift, in which multiple scan chains are formed and only one group of the scan chains is shifted at a time. However, previous methods based on this approach use random grouping, which may reduce global shift switching activity, but may not be optimized to reduce local shift switching activity, resulting in remaining high risk of test data corruption even when partial-shift is applied. This paper proposes novel algorithms (one optimal and one heuristic) to group scan chains, focusing on reducing local shift switching activity around scan flip-flops, thus reducing the risk of test data corruption. Experimental results on all large ITC'99 benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal and heuristic algorithms as well as the scalability of the heuristic algorithm.

TI Native Build System for Unity Builds with Sophisticated Bundle
   Strategies
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English

DE build systems; unity builds; C plus
AB Build systems are essential tools for developing large software projects. Traditionally, build systems have been designed for high incremental-build performance. However, the longer build times of recent large C++ projects have imposed a requirement on build systems: i.e., unity builds. Unity builds are a build technique for speeding up sequential compilation of many source files by bundling multiple source files into one. Unity builds lead to a significant reduction in build time through removal of redundant parsing of shared header files. However, unity builds have a negative effect on incremental builds because each compiler task gets larger. Our previous study reported existing unity builds overlook many better bundle configurations that improve unity-build performance without increasing the incremental-build time. Motivated by the problem, we present a novel build system for better performance in unity builds. Our build system aims to achieve competitive unity-build performance in full builds with mitigating the negative effect on incremental builds. To accomplish this goal, our build system uses sophisticated bundle strategies developed on the basis of hints extracted from the preprocessed code of each source file. Thanks to the strategies, our build system finds better bundle configurations that improve both of the full-build performance and the incremental-build performance in unity builds. For example, in comparison with the state-of-the-art unity builds of WebKit, our build system improves build performance by 9% in full builds, by 39% in incremental builds, and by 23% in continuous builds that include both types of the builds.

DE network virtualization; distributed virtual network recovery; parallel;

AB How to restore virtual network against substrate network failure (e.g. link cut) is one of the key challenges of network virtualization. The traditional virtual network recovery (VNR) methods are mostly based on the idea of centralized control. However, if multiple virtual networks fail at the same time, their recovery processes are usually queued according to a specific priority, which may increase the average waiting time of users. In this letter, we study distributed virtual network recovery (DVNR) method to improve the virtual network recovery efficiency. We establish exclusive virtual machine (VM) for each virtual network and process recovery requests of multiple virtual networks in parallel. Simulation results show that the proposed DVNR method can obtain recovery success rate closely to centralized VNR method while yield similar to 70% less average recovery time.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Path planning and motion control are fundamental components to realize safe and reliable autonomous driving. The discrimination of the role of these two components, however, is somewhat obscure because of strong mathematical interaction between these two components. This often results in a redundant computation in the implementation. One of attracting idea to overcome this redundancy is a simultaneous path planning and motion control (SPPMC) based on a model predictive control framework. SPPMC finds the optimal control input considering not only the vehicle dynamics but also the various constraints which reflect the physical limitations, safety constraints and so on to achieve the goal of a given behavior. In driving in the real traffic environment, decision making has also strong interaction with planning and control. This is much more emphasized in the case that several tasks are switched in some context to realize higher-level tasks. This paper presents a basic idea to integrate decision making, path planning and motion control which is able to be executed in realtime. In particular, lane-changing behavior together with the decision of its initiation is selected as the target task. The proposed idea is based on the nonlinear model predictive control and appropriate switching of the cost function and constraints in it. As the result, the decision of the initiation, planning, and control of the lane-changing behavior are achieved by solving a single optimization problem under several constraints such as safety. The validity of the proposed method is tested by using a vehicle simulator.

TI Non-Linear Distance Filter for Modeling Effect of a Large Pointer Used

AB When using a gesture-based interface for pointing to targets on a wide screen, displaying a large pointer instead of a typical spot pattern reduces disturbance caused by measurement errors of user's pointing posture. However, it remains unclear why a large pointer helps facilitate easy pointing. To examine this issue, in this study we propose a mathematical model that formulates human pointing motions affected by a large pointer. Our idea is to describe the effect of the large pointer as human visual perception, because the user will perceive the pointer-target distance as being shorter than it actually is. We embedded this scheme, referred to as non-linear distance filter (NDF), into a typical feedback loop model designed to formulate human pointing motions. We also proposed a method to estimate NDF mapping from pointing trajectories, and used it to investigate the applicability of the model under three typical disturbance patterns: small vibration, smooth shift, and step signal. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed NDF-based model could accurately reproduced actual pointing trajectories, achieving high similarity values of 0.89, 0.97, and 0.91 for the three respective disturbance patterns. The results indicate the applicability of the proposed method. In addition, we confirmed that the obtained NDF mappings suggested rationales for why a large pointer helps facilitate easy pointing.

AB Finding the correspondence between two images of the same object or scene is an active research field in computer vision. This paper develops a rapid and effective Content-based Superpixel Image matching and Stitching (CSIS) scheme, which utilizes the content of superpixel through multi-features fusion technique. Unlike popular keypoint-based matching method, our approach proposes a superpixel internal feature-based scheme to implement image matching. In the beginning, we make use of a novel superpixel generation algorithm based on content-based feature representation, named Content-based Superpixel Segmentation (CSS) algorithm. Superpixels are generated in terms of a new distance metric using color, spatial, and gradient feature information. It is developed to balance the compactness and the boundary adherence of resulted superpixels. Then, we calculate the entropy of each superpixel for separating some superpixels with significant characteristics. Next, for each selected superpixel, its multi-features descriptor is generated by extracting and fusing local features of the selected superpixel itself. Finally, we compare the matching features of candidate superpixels and their own neighborhoods to estimate the correspondence between two images. We evaluated superpixel matching and image stitching on complex and deformable surfaces using our superpixel region descriptors, and the results show that new method is effective in matching accuracy and execution speed.

AB This work aims to determine the propensity of password creation through the lens of language spheres. To this end, we consider four different countries, each with a different culture/language: China/Chinese, United Kingdom (UK) and India/English, and Japan/Japanese. We first employ a user study to verify whether language and culture are reflected in password creation. We found that users in India, Japan, and the UK prefer to create their passwords from base words, and the kinds of words they are incorporated into passwords vary between countries. We then test whether the findings obtained through the user study are reflected in a corpus of leaked passwords. We found that users in China and Japan prefer dates, while users in India, Japan, and the UK prefer names. We also found that cultural words (e.g., "sakura" in Japan and "football" in the UK) are frequently used to create passwords. Finally, we demonstrate that the knowledge on the linguistic background of targeted users can be exploited to increase the speed of the password guessing process.

ID DEFECT PREDICTION; REGRESSION
AB To enhance the prediction accuracy of the number of faults, many studies proposed various prediction models. The model is built using a dataset collected in past projects, and the number of faults is predicted using the model and the data of the current project. Datasets sometimes have many data points where the dependent variable, i.e., the number of faults is zero. When a multiple linear regression model is made using the dataset, the model may not be built properly. To avoid the problem, the Tobit model is considered to be effective when predicting software faults. The model assumes that the range of a dependent variable is limited and the model is built based on the assumption. Similar to the Tobit model, the Poisson regression model assumes there are many data points whose value is zero on the dependent variable. Also, log-transformation is sometimes applied to enhance the accuracy of the model. Additionally, ensemble methods are effective to enhance prediction accuracy of the models. We evaluated the prediction accuracy of the methods separately, when the number of faults is zero and not zero. In the experiment, our proposed ensemble method showed the highest accuracy, and Pred25 was 21% when the number of faults was not zero, and it was 45% when the number was zero.

TI Loss-Driven Channel Pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks

AB The increase in computation cost and storage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) severely hinders their applications on limited-resources devices in recent years. As a result, there is impending necessity to accelerate the networks by certain methods. In this paper, we propose a loss-driven method to prune redundant channels of CNNs. It identifies unimportant channels by using Taylor expansion technique regarding to scaling and shifting factors, and prunes those channels by fixed percentile threshold. By doing so, we obtain a compact network with less parameters and FLOPs consumption. In experimental section, we evaluate the proposed method in CIFAR datasets with several popular networks, including VGG-19, DenseNet-40 and ResNet-164, and experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is able to prune over 70% channels and parameters with no performance loss. Moreover, iterative pruning could be used to obtain more compact network.

TI Gradient-Enhanced Softmax for Face Recognition

DT Article
DE convolutional neural network; face recognition; softmax classifier;
   vanishing gradient
AB This letter proposes a gradient-enhanced softmax supervisor for face recognition (FR) based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The proposed supervisor conducts the constant-normalized cosine to obtain the score for each class using a combination of the intra-class score and the soft maximum of the inter-class scores as the objective function. This mitigates the vanishing gradient problem in the conventional softmax classifier. The experiments on the public Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database denote that the proposed supervisor achieves better results when compared with those achieved using the current state-of-the-art softmax-based approaches for FR.

AB A regular pattern is a string consisting of constant symbols and distinct variable symbols. The language of a regular pattern is the set of all constant strings obtained by replacing all variable symbols in the regular pattern with non-empty strings. The present paper deals with the learning problem of languages of regular patterns within Angluin's query learning model, which is an established mathematical model of learning via queries in computational learning theory. The class of languages of regular patterns was known to be identifiable from one positive example using a polynomial number of membership queries, in the query learning model. In present paper, we show that the class of languages of regular patterns is identifiable from one positive example using a linear number of membership queries, with respect to the length of the positive example.

TI Virtual Address Remapping with Configurable Tiles in Image Processing
   Applications
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE address mapping; memory management units; image processing; performance;
   embedded system architectures
AB The conventional linear or tiled address maps can degrade performance and memory utilization when traffic patterns are not matched with an underlying address map. The address map is usually fixed at design time. Accordingly, it is difficult to adapt to given applications. Modern embedded system usually accommodates memory management units (MMUs). As a result, depending on virtual address patterns, the system can suffer from performance overheads due to page table walks. To alleviate this performance overhead, we propose to cluster and rearrange tiles to construct an MMU-aware configurable address map. To construct the clustered tiled map, the generic tile number remapping algorithm is presented. In the presented scheme, an address map is configured based on the adaptive dimensioning algorithm. Considering image processing applications, a design, an analysis, an implementation, and simulations are conducted. The results indicate the proposed method can improve the performance and the memory utilization with moderate hardware costs.

AB With the recent advances in e-commerce, it has become important to recommend not only mass-produced daily items, such as books, but also items that are not mass-produced. In this study, we present an algorithm for real estate recommendations. Automatic property recommendations are a highly difficult task because no identical properties exist in the world, occupied properties cannot be recommended, and users rent or buy properties only a few times in their lives. For the first step of property recommendation, we predict users' preferences for properties by combining content-based filtering and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). In the MLP, we use not only attribute data of users and properties, but also deep features extracted from property floor plan images. As a result, we successfully predict users' preference with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.166.

AB This paper proposes and examines the three in-memory shuffling methods designed to address problems in MapReduce shuffling caused by skewed data. Coupled Shuffle Architecture (CSA) employs a single pairwise all-to-all exchange to shuffle both blocks, units of shuffle transfer, and meta-blocks, which contain the metadata of corresponding blocks. Decoupled Shuffle Architecture (DSA) separates the shuffling of meta-blocks and blocks, and applies different all-to-all exchange algorithms to each shuffling process, attempting to mitigate the impact of stragglers in strongly skewed distributions. Decoupled Shuffle Architecture with Skew-Aware Meta-Shuffle (DSA w/ SMS) autonomously determines the proper placement of blocks based on the memory consumption of each worker process. This approach targets extremely skewed situations where some worker processes could exceed their node memory limitation. This study evaluates implementations of the three shuffling methods in our prototype in-memory MapReduce engine, which employs high performance interconnects such as InfiniBand and Intel Omni-Path. Our results suggest that DSA w/ SMS is the only viable solution for extremely skewed data distributions. We also present a detailed investigation of the performance of CSA and DSA in various skew situations.

AB Biomedical event extraction is an important and challenging task in Information Extraction, which plays a key role for medicine research and disease prevention. Most of the existing event detection methods are based on shallow machine learning methods which mainly rely on domain knowledge and elaborately designed features. Another challenge is that some crucial information as well as the interactions among words or arguments may be ignored since most works treat words and sentences equally. Therefore, we employ a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) neural network for event extraction, which can skip handcrafted complex feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level attention mechanism, including word level attention which determines the importance of words in a sentence, and the sentence level attention which determines the importance of relevant arguments. Finally, we train dependency word embeddings and add sentence vectors to enrich semantic information. The experimental results show that our model achieves an F-score of 59.61% on the commonly used dataset (MLEE) of biomedical event extraction, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

TI PMOP: Efficient Per-Page Most-Offset Prefetcher

LA English
DT Article
DE memory hierarchy; cache; hardware prefetching
AB Hardware prefetching involves a sophisticated balance between accuracy, coverage, and timeliness while minimizing hardware cost. Recent prefetchers have achieved these goals, but they still require complex hardware and a significant amount of storage. In this paper, we propose an efficient Per-page Most-Offset Prefetcher (PMOP) that minimizes hardware cost and simultaneously improves accuracy while maintaining coverage and timeliness. We achieve these objectives using an enhanced offset prefetcher that performs well with a reasonable hardware cost. Our approach first addresses coverage and timeliness by allowing multiple Most-Offset predictions. To minimize offset interference between pages, the PMOP leverages a fine-grain per-page offset filter. This filter records the access history with page-IDs, which enables efficient mapping and tracking of multiple offset streams from diverse pages. Analysis results show that PMOP outperforms the state-of-the-art Signature Path Prefetcher while reducing storage overhead by a factor of 3.4.

TI A Part-Based Gaussian Reweighted Approach for Occluded Vehicle Detection
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE vehicle detection; occlusion; reweight
AB Vehicle detection is challenging in natural traffic scenes because there exist a lot of occlusion. Because of occlusion, detector's training strategy may lead to mismatch between features and labels. As a result, some predicted bounding boxes may shift to surrounding vehicles and lead to lower confidences. These bounding boxes will lead to lower AP value. In this letter, we propose a new approach to address this problem. We calculate the center of visible part of current vehicle based on road information. Then a variable-radius Gaussian weight based method is applied to reweight each anchor box in loss function based on the center of visible part in training time of SSD. The reweighted method has ability to predict higher confidences and more accurate bounding boxes. Besides, the model also has high speed and can be trained end-to-end. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms some competitive methods in terms of speed and accuracy.

AB As big data attracts attention in a variety of fields, research on data exploration for analyzing large-scale scientific data has gained popularity. To support exploratory analysis of scientific data, effective summarization and visualization of the target data as well as seamless cooperation with modern data management systems are in demand. In this paper, we focus on the exploration-based analysis of scientific array data, and define a spatial V-Optimal histogram to summarize it based on the notion of histograms in the database research area. We propose histogram construction approaches based on a general hierarchical partitioning as well as a more specific one, the l-grid partitioning, for effective and efficient data visualization in scientific data analysis. In addition, we implement the proposed algorithms on the state-of-the-art array DBMS, which is appropriate to process and manage scientific data. Experiments are conducted using massive evacuation simulation data in tsunami disasters, real taxi data as well as synthetic data, to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.

AB This paper describes the advantages and disadvantages observed when describing complex parameterizable Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) at the behavioral level using SystemC and at the Register Transfer Level (RTL) using VHDL. ANNs are complex to parameterize because they have a configurable number of layers, and each one of them has a unique configuration. This kind of structure makes ANNs, a priori, challenging to parameterize using Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Thus, it seems intuitively that ANNs would benefit from the raise in level of abstraction from RTL to behavioral level. This paper presents the results of implementing an ANN using both levels of abstractions. Results surprisingly show that VHDL leads to better results and allows a much higher degree of parameterization than SystemC. The implementation of these parameterizable ANNs are made open source and are freely available online. Finally, at the end of the paper we make some recommendation for future HLS tools to improve their parameterization capabilities.

AB We present an automated lemma generation method for equational, inductive theorem proving based on the term rewriting induction of Reddy and Aoto as well as the divergence critic framework of Walsh. The method effectively works by using the divergence-detection technique to locate differences in diverging sequences, and generates potential lemmas automatically by analyzing these differences. We have incorporated this method in the multi-context inductive theorem prover of Sato and Kurihara to overcome the strategic problems resulting from the unsoundness of the method. The experimental results show that our method is effective especially for some problems diverging with complex differences (i.e., parallel and nested differences).

AB The order/degree problem consists of finding the smallest diameter graph for a given order and degree. Such a graph is beneficial for designing low-latency networks with high performance for massively parallel computers. The average shortest path length (ASPL) of a graph has an influence on latency. In this paper, we propose a novel order adjustment approach. In the proposed approach, we search for Cayley graphs of the given degree that are close to the given order. We then adjust the order of the best Cayley graph to meet the given order. For some order and degree pairs, we explain how to derive the smallest known graphs from the Graph Golf 2016 and 2017 competitions.

TI Avoiding Performance Impacts by Re-Replication Workload Shifting in HDFS

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE re-replication; fault tolerance; data reliability; HDFS
ID SIMULATION
AB Data replication in cloud storage systems brings a lot of benefits, such as fault tolerance, data availability, data locality and load balancing both from reliability and performance perspectives. However, each time a datanode fails, data blocks stored on the failed datanode must be restored to maintain replication level. This may be a large burden for the system in which resources are highly utilized with users' application workloads. Although there have been many proposals for replication, the approach of re-replication has not been properly addressed yet. In this paper, we present a deferred re-replication algorithm to dynamically shift the re-replication workload based on current resource utilization status of the system. As workload pattern varies depending on the time of the day, simulation results from synthetic workload demonstrate a large opportunity for minimizing impacts on users' application workloads with the simple algorithm that adjusts re-replication based on current resource utilization. Our approach can reduce performance impacts on users' application workloads while ensuring the same reliability level as default HDFS can provide.

AB Critical nodes identification is of great significance in protecting power grids. Network efficiency can be used as an evaluation index to identify the critical nodes and is an indicator to quantify how efficiently a network exchanges information and transmits energy. Since power grid is a heterogeneous network and can be decomposed into small functionally-independent grids, the concept of the Giant Component does not apply to power grids. In this paper, we first model the power grid as the directed graph and define the Giant Efficiency sub-Graph (GEsG). The GEsG is the functionally-independent unit of the network where electric energy can be transmitted from a generation node (i.e., power plants) to some demand nodes (i.e., transmission stations and distribution stations) via the shortest path. Secondly, we propose an algorithm to evaluate the importance of nodes by calculating their critical degree, results of which can be used to identify critical nodes in heterogeneous networks. Thirdly, we define node efficiency loss to verify the accuracy of critical nodes identification (CNI) algorithm and compare the results that GEsG and Giant Component are separately used as assessment criteria for computing the node efficiency loss. Experiments prove the accuracy and efficiency of our CNI algorithm and show that the GEsG can better reflect heterogeneous characteristics and power transmission of power grids than the Giant Component. Our investigation leads to a counterintuitive finding that the most important critical nodes may not be the generation nodes but some demand nodes.

AB Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency in the world with a total marketcap of nearly USD 33 billion, [1] with 370,000 transactions recorded daily [2]. Pseudo-anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash systems such as Bitcoin have caused a paradigm shift in the way that people conduct financial transactions and purchase goods. Although cryptocurrencies enable users to securely and anonymously exchange money, they can also facilitate illegal criminal activities. Therefore, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies develop appropriate analytical processes that will allow them to identify and investigate criminal activities in the Blockchain (a distributed ledger). In this paper, INTERPOL, through the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation, proposes a Bitcoin analytical framework and a software system that will assist law enforcement agencies in the real-time analysis of the Blockchain while providing digital crime analysts with tracing and visualization capabilities. By doing so, it is feasible to render transactions decipherable and comprehensible for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors. The proposed solution is evaluated against three criminal case studies linked to Darknet markets, ransomware and DDoS extortion.

AB Certain open issues challenge the software engineering of autonomous robot software (ARS). One issue is to provide enabling software technologies to support autonomous and rational behaviours of robots operating in an open environment, and another issue is the development of an effective engineering approach to manage the complexity of ARS to simplify the development, deployment and evolution of ARS. We introduce the software framework AutoRobot to address these issues. This software provides abstraction and a model of accompanying behaviours to formulate the behaviour patterns of autonomous robots and enrich the coherence between task behaviours and observation behaviours, thereby improving the capabilities of obtaining and using the feedback regarding the changes. A dual-loop control model is presented to support flexible interactions among the control activities to support continuous adjustments of the robot's behaviours. A multi-agent software architecture is proposed to encapsulate the fundamental software components. Unlike most existing research, in AutoRobot, the ARS is designed as a multi-agent system in which the software agents interact and cooperate with each other to accomplish the robot's task. AutoRobot provides reusable software packages to support the development of ARS and infrastructure integrated with ROS to support the decentralized deployment and running of ARS. We develop an ARS sample to illustrate how to use the framework and validate its effectiveness.

AB This paper proposes a novel domain adaptation method that can utilize out-of-domain text resources and partially domain matched text resources in language modeling. A major problem in domain adaptation is that it is hard to obtain adequate adaptation effects from out-ofdomain text resources. To tackle the problem, our idea is to carry out model merger in a latent variable space created from latent words language models (LWLMs). The latent variables in the LWLMs are represented as specific words selected from the observed word space, so LWLMs can share a common latent variable space. It enables us to perform flexible mixture modeling with consideration of the latent variable space. This paper presents two types of mixture modeling, i.e., LWLM mixture models and LWLM cross-mixture models. The LWLM mixture models can perform a latent word space mixture modeling to mitigate domain mismatch problem. Furthermore, in the LWLM cross-mixture models, LMs which individually constructed from partially matched text resources are split into two element models, each of which can be subjected to mixture modeling. For the approaches, this paper also describes methods to optimize mixture weights using a validation data set. Experiments show that the mixture in latent word space can achieve performance improvements for both target domain and out-of-domain compared with that in observed word space.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB We consider online linear optimization over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, which has various applications including the online collaborative filtering. The problem is formulated as a repeated game between the algorithm and the adversary, where in each round t the algorithm and the adversary choose matrices X-t and L-t, respectively, and then the algorithm suffers a loss given by the Frobenius inner product of X-t and L-t. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the cumulative loss. We can employ a standard framework called Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) for designing algorithms, where we need to choose an appropriate regularization function to obtain a good performance guarantee. We show that the log-determinant regularization works better than other popular regularization functions in the case where the loss matrices L-t are all sparse. Using this property, we show that our algorithm achieves an optimal performance guarantee for the online collaborative filtering. The technical contribution of the paper is to develop a new technique of deriving performance bounds by exploiting the property of strong convexity of the log-determinant with respect to the loss matrices, while in the previous analysis the strong convexity is defined with respect to a norm. Intuitively, skipping the norm analysis results in the improved bound. Moreover, we apply our method to online linear optimization over vectors and show that the FTRL with the Burg entropy regularizer, which is the analogue of the log-determinant regularizer in the vector case, works well.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB 3D ball tracking is of great significance in ping-pong game analysis, which can be utilized to applications such as TV contents and tactic analysis, with some of them requiring real-time implementation. This paper proposes a CPU-GPU platform based Particle Filter for multi-view ball tracking including 4 proposals. The multi-peak estimation and the ball-like observation model are proposed in the algorithm design. The multi-peak estimation aims at obtaining a precise ball position in case the particles' likelihood distribution has multiple peaks under complex circumstances. The ball-like observation model with 4 different likelihood evaluation, utilizes the ball's unique features to evaluate the particle's similarity with the target. In the GPU implementation, the double-queue structure and the vectorized data combination are proposed. The double-queue structure aims at achieving task parallelism between some data-independent tasks. The vectorized data combination reduces the time cost in memory access by combining 3 different image data to 1 vector data. Experiments are based on ping-pong videos recorded in an official match taken by 4 cameras located in 4 corners of the court. The tracking success rate reaches 99.59% on CPU. With the GPU acceleration, the time consumption is 8.8 ms/frame, which is sped up by a factor of 98 compared with its CPU version.

AB System scenarios that derived from system design specification play an important role in the reliability engineering of component-based software systems. Several scenario-based approaches have been proposed to predict the reliability of a system at the design time, most of them adopt flat construction of scenarios, which doesn't conform to software design specifications and is subject to introduce state space explosion problem in the large systems. This paper identifies various challenges related to scenario modeling at the early design stages based on software architecture specification. A novel scenario-based reliability modeling and prediction approach is introduced. The approach adopts hierarchical scenario specification to model software reliability to avoid state space explosion and reduce computational complexity. Finally, the evaluation experiment shows the potential of the approach.

AB Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices are applied for accelerating specific calculations and reducing power consumption in a wide range of areas. One of the challenges associated with FPGAs is reducing static power for enforcing their power effectiveness. We propose a method involving fine-grained reconfiguration of body biases of logic and net resources to reduce the static power of FPGA devices. In addition, we develop an FPGA device called Flex Power FPGA with SOTB technology and demonstrate its power reduction function with a 32-bit counter circuit. In this paper, we describe the construction of an experimental platform to precisely evaluate power consumption and the maximum operating frequency of the device under various operating voltages and body biases with various practical circuits. Using the abovementioned platform, we evaluate the Flex Power FPGA chip at operating voltages of 0.5-1.0 V and at body biases of 0.0-0.5 V. In the evaluation, we use a 32-bit adder, 16-bit multiplier, and an SBOX circuit for AES cryptography. We operate the chip virtually with uniformed body bias voltage to drive all of the logic resources with the same threshold voltage. We demonstrate the advantage of the Flex Power FPGA by comparing its performance with non-reconfigurable biasing.

TI ArchHDL: A Novel Hardware RTL Modeling and High-Speed Simulation
   Environment
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE hardware description language; RTL modeling; RTL simulation
AB LSIs are generally designed through four stages including architectural design, logic design, circuit design, and physical design. In architectural design and logic design, designers describe their target hardware in RTL. However, they generally use different languages for each phase. Typically a general purpose programming language such as C or C++ and a hardware description language such as Verilog HDL or VHDL are used for architectural design and logic design, respectively. That is time-consuming way for designing a hardware and more efficient design environment is required. In this paper, we propose a new hardware modeling and high-speed simulation environment for architectural design and logic design. Our environment realizes writing and verifying hardware by one language. The environment consists of (1) a new hardware description language called ArchHDL, which enables to simulate hardware faster than Verilog HDL simulation, and (2) a source code translation tool from ArchHDL code to Verilog HDL code. ArchHDL is a new language for hardware RTL modeling based on C++. The key features of this language are that (1) designers describe a combinational circuit as a function and (2) the ArchHDL library realizes non-blocking assignment in C++. Using these features, designers are able to write a hardware transparently from abstracted level description to RTL description in Verilog HDL-like style. Source codes in ArchHDL is converted to Verilog HDL codes by the translation tool and they are used to synthesize for FPGAs or ASICs. As the evaluation of our environment, we implemented a practical many-core processor in ArchHDL and measured the simulation speed on an Intel CPU and an Intel Xeon Phi processor. The simulation speed for the Intel CPU by ArchHDL achieves about 4.5 times faster than the simulation speed by Synopsys VCS. We also confirmed that the RTL simulation by ArchHDL is efficiently parallelized on the Intel Xeon Phi processor. We convert the ArchHDL code to a Verilog HDL code and estimated the hardware utilization on an FPGA. To implement a 48-node many-core processor, 71% of entire resources of a Virtex-7 FPGA are consumed.

AB In this paper, a novel method for pitch estimation and voicing classification is proposed using reconstructed spectrum from Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). The proposed algorithm reconstructs spectrum from MFCC with Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse by Mel-scale weighting functions. The reconstructed spectrum is compressed and filtered in log-frequency. Pitch estimation is achieved by modeling the joint density of pitch frequency and the filter spectrum with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Voicing classification is also achieved by GMM-based model, and the test results show that over 99% frames can be correctly classified. The results of pitch estimation demonstrate that the proposed GMM-based pitch estimator has high accuracy, and the relative error is 6.68% on TIMIT database.

ID FACE RECOGNITION
AB In this paper, we present a novel regression-based robust locality preserving projections (RRLPP) method to effectively deal with the issue of noise and occlusion in facial expression recognition. Similar to robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and robust regression (RR) approach, the basic idea of the presented RRLPP approach is also to lead in the low-rank term and the sparse term of facial expression image sample matrix to simultaneously overcome the shortcoming of the locality preserving projections (LPP) method and enhance the robustness of facial expression recognition. However, RRLPP is a nonlinear robust subspace method which can effectively describe the local structure of facial expression images. The test results on the Multi-PIE facial expression database indicate that the RRLPP method can effectively eliminate the noise and the occlusion problem of facial expression images, and it also can achieve better or comparative facial expression recognition rate compared to the non-robust and robust subspace methods meantime.

ID COMPRESSION
AB A robust identification scheme for JPEG images is proposed in this paper. The aim is to robustly identify JPEG images that are generated from the same original image, under various compression conditions such as differences in compression ratios and initial quantization matrices. The proposed scheme does not provide any false negative matches in principle. In addition, secure features, which do not have any visual information, are used to achieve not only a robust identification scheme but also secure one. Conventional schemes can not avoid providing false negative matches under some compression conditions, and are required to manage a secret key for secure identification. The proposed scheme is applicable to the uploading process of images on social networks like Twitter for image retrieval and forensics. A number of experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method outperforms conventional ones in terms of query performances, while keeping a reasonable security level.

DE rule language; rule-based reasoner; benchmark
AB With the Semantic Web data standards defined, more applications demand inference engines in providing support for intelligent processing of the Semantic Web data. Rule-based inference engines or rule-based reasoners are used in many domains, such as in clinical support, and e-commerce recommender system development. This article reviews and compares key features of three freely-available rule-based reasoners: Jena inference engine, Euler YAP Engine, and BaseVISor. A performance evaluation study was conducted to assess the scalability and efficiency of these systems using data and rule sets adapted from the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark. We describe our methodology in assessing rule-based reasoners based on the benchmark. The study result shows the efficiency of the systems in performing reasoning tasks over different data sizes and rules involving various rule properties. The review and comparison results can provide a basis for users in choosing appropriate rule-based inference engines to match their application requirements.

AB There are many software systems that have been used and maintained for a long time. By undergoing such a maintenance process, similar code fragments were intentionally left in the source code of such software, and knowing how to manage a software system that contains a lot of similar code fragments becomes a major concern. In this study, we proposed a method to pick up components that were commonly used in similar code fragments from a target software system. This method was realized by using the component rank model and by checking the differences of evaluation values for each component before and after merging components that had similar code fragments. In many cases, components whose evaluation value had decreased would be used by both the components that were merged, so we considered that these components were commonly used in similar code fragments. Based on the proposed approach, we implemented a system to calculate differences of evaluation values for each component, and conducted three evaluation experiments to confirm that our method was useful for detecting components that were commonly used in similar code fragments, and to confirm how our method can help developers when developers add similar components. Based on the experimental results, we also discuss some improvement methods and provide the results from applications of these methods.

AB Coordinated checkpointing is a widely-used checkpoint/restart protocol for fault-tolerance in large-scale HPC systems. However, this protocol will involve massive amounts of I/O concentration, resulting in considerably high checkpoint overhead and high energy consumption. This paper focuses on speculative checkpointing, a CPR mechanism that allows for temporal distribution of checkpointings to avoid I/O concentration. We propose execution time and energy models for speculative checkpointing, and investigate energy-performance characteristics when speculative checkpointing is adopted in exascale systems. Using these models, we study the benefit of speculative checkpointing over coordinated checkpointing under various realistic scenarios for exascale HPC systems. We show that, compared to coordinated checkpointing, speculative checkpointing can achieve up to a 11% energy reduction at the cost of a relatively-small increase in the execution time. In addition, a significant energy-performance trade-off is expected when the system scale exceeds 1.2 million nodes.

DE Internet of Things; bottle cap; liquid flow
AB We present a new simple Internet of Things (IoT) device that we call "Smart Bottle Cap", which enables a standard bottle to become a user-controllable liquid pouring system. It consists of a mini vacuum pump to start the liquid flowing, a microcontroller to control the liquid flow, a BLE module to connect it to a smartphone, an accelerometer to detect the tilt angle of the bottle, an LED for drawing the attention of users, and a 3.7 V LiPo battery. The device's novel point is that a flow control mechanism built into a standard bottle cap makes the system suitable for general use and enables it to be easily extended.

DE use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities; UAF attack-prevention;
   memory-reuse-prohibited library; system security
AB Recently, there has been an increase in use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities, which are exploited using a dangling pointer that refers to a freed memory. In particular, large-scale programs such as browsers often include many dangling pointers, and UAF vulnerabilities are frequently exploited by drive-by download attacks. Various methods to prevent UAF attacks have been proposed. However, only a few methods can effectively prevent UAF attacks during runtime with low overhead. In this paper, we propose HeapRevolver, which is a novel UAF attack-prevention-method that delays and randomizes the timing of release of freed memory area by using a memory-reuse-prohibited library, which prohibits a freed memory area from being reused for a certain period. The first condition for reuse is that the total size of the freed memory area is beyond the designated size. The threshold for the conditions of reuse of the freed memory area can be randomized by HeapRevolver. Furthermore, we add a second condition for reuse in which the freed memory area is merged with an adjacent freed memory area before release. Furthermore, HeapRevolver can be applied without modifying the target programs. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of HeapRevolver in Linux and Windows, and report its evaluation results. The results show that HeapRevolver can prevent attacks that exploit existing UAF vulnerabilities. In addition, the overhead is small.

AB Existing moving object's trajectory prediction algorithms suffer from the data sparsity problem, which affects the accuracy of the trajectory prediction. Aiming to the problem, we present an Entropy-based Sparse Trajectories Prediction method enhanced by Matrix Factorization (ESTP-MF). Firstly, we do trajectory synthesis based on trajectory entropy and put synthesized trajectories into the trajectory space. It can resolve the sparse problem of trajectory data and make the new trajectory space more reliable. Secondly, under the new trajectory space, we introduce matrix factorization into Markov models to improve the sparse trajectory prediction. It uses matrix factorization to infer transition probabilities of the missing regions in terms of corresponding existing elements in the transition probability matrix. It aims to further solve the problem of data sparsity. Experiments with a real trajectory dataset show that ESTP-MF generally improves prediction accuracy by as much as 6% and 4% compared to the SubSyn algorithm and STP-EE algorithm respectively.

DE fine-grained classification; object detection; neural network
AB Recently, numerous methods have been proposed to tackle the problem of fine-grained image classification. However, rare of them focus on the pre-processing step of image alignment. In this paper, we propose a new pre-processing method with the aim of reducing the variance of objects among the same class. As a result, the variance of objects between different classes will be more significant. The proposed approach consists of four procedures. The "parts" of the objects are firstly located. After that, the rotation angle and the bounding box could be obtained based on the spatial relationship of the "parts". Finally, all the images are resized to similar sizes. The objects in the images possess the properties of translation, scale and rotation invariance after processed by the proposed method. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and CUB-200-2010 datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method could boost the recognition performance by serving as a pre-processing step of several popular classification algorithms.

DE compromised website; drive-by download; redirection graph; program trace
AB An incident response organization such as a CSIRT contributes to preventing the spread of malware infection by analyzing compromised websites and sending abuse reports with detected URLs to webmasters. However, these abuse reports with only URLs are not sufficient to clean up the websites. In addition, it is difficult to analyze malicious websites across different client environments because these websites change behavior depending on a client environment. To expedite compromised website clean-up, it is important to provide fine-grained information such as malicious URL relations, the precise position of compromised web content, and the target range of client environments. In this paper, we propose a new method of constructing a redirection graph with context, such as which web content redirects to malicious websites. The proposed method analyzes a website in a multi-client environment to identify which client environment is exposed to threats. We evaluated our system using crawling datasets of approximately 2,000 compromised websites. The result shows that our system successfully identified malicious URL relations and compromised web content, and the number of URLs and the amount of web content to be analyzed were sufficient for incident responders by 15.0% and 0.8%, respectively. Furthermore, it can also identify the target range of client environments in 30.4% of websites and a vulnerability that has been used in malicious websites by leveraging target information. This finegrained analysis by our system would contribute to improving the daily work of incident responders.

AB Subspace representation model is an important subset of visual tracking algorithms. Compared with models performed on the original data space, subspace representation model can effectively reduce the computational complexity, and filter out high dimensional noises. However, for some complicated situations, e.g., dramatic illumination changing, large area of occlusion and abrupt object drifting, traditional subspace representation models may fail to handle the visual tracking task. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace representation algorithm for robust visual tracking by using low-rank representation with graph constraints (LRGC). Low-rank representation has been well-known for its superiority of handling corrupted samples, and graph constraint is flexible to characterize sample relationship. In this paper, we aim to exploit benefits from both low-rank representation and graph constraint, and deploy it to handle challenging visual tracking problems. Specifically, we first propose a novel graph structure to characterize the relationship of target object in different observation states. Then we learn a subspace by jointly optimizing low-rank representation and graph embedding in a unified framework. Finally, the learned subspace is embedded into a Bayesian inference framework by using the dynamical model and the observation model. Experiments on several video benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than traditional ones, especially in dynamically changing and drifting situations.

TI Supervisory Control of Partially Observed Quantitative Discrete Event
   Systems for Fixed-Initial-Credit Energy Problem

LA English
DT Article
DE supervisory control; discrete event system; partial observation; optimal
   control; energy game
AB This paper studies the supervisory control of partially observed quantitative discrete event systems (DESs) under the fixed-initial-credit energy objective. A quantitative DES is modeled by a weighted automaton whose event set is partitioned into a controllable event set and an uncontrollable event set. Partial observation is modeled by a mapping from each event and state of the DES to the corresponding masked event and masked state that are observed by a supervisor. The supervisor controls the DES by disabling or enabling any controllable event for the current state of the DES, based on the observed sequences of masked states and masked events. We model the control process as a two-player game played between the supervisor and the DES. The DES aims to execute the events so that its energy level drops below zero, while the supervisor aims to maintain the energy level above zero. We show that the proposed problem is reducible to finding a winning strategy in a turn-based reachability game.

AB In this letter, we present a novel method for reconstructing continuous data field from scattered point data, which leads to a more characteristic visualization result by volume rendering. The gradient distribution of scattered point data is analyzed for local feature investigation via singular-value decomposition. A data-adaptive ellipsoidal shaped function is constructed as the penalty function to evaluate point weight coefficient in MLS approximation. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the reconstruction error and get a visualization with better feature discrimination.

TI Fast Persistent Heap Based on Non-Volatile Memory

DT Article
DE non-volatile memory; virtual memory manager; direct access
AB New volatile memory (e.g. Phase Change Memroy) presents fast access, large capacity, byte-addressable, and non-volatility features. These features will bring impacts on the design of current software system. It has become a hot research topic of how to manage it and provide what kind of interface for upper application to use it. This paper proposes FP-Heap. FP-Heap supports direct access to non-volatile memory through a persistent heap interface. With FP-Heap, traditional persistent object systems can benefit directly from the byte-persistency of non-volatile memory. FP-Heap extends current virtual memory manager (VMM) to manage non-volatile memory and maintain a persistent mapping relationship. Also, FP-Heap offers a lightweight transaction mechanism to support atomic update of persistent data, a simple namespace to facilitate data indexing, and a basic access control mechanism to support data sharing. Compared with previous work Mnemosyne, FP-Heap achieves higher performance by its customized VMM and optimized transaction mechanism.

ID NONNATIVE SPEECH
AB Recognition of second language (L2) speech is a challenging task even for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, partly because pronunciation by L2 speakers is usually significantly influenced by the mother tongue of the speakers. Considering that the expressions of non-native speakers are usually simpler than those of native ones, and that second language speech usually includes mispronunciation and less fluent pronunciation, we propose a novel method that maximizes unified acoustic and linguistic objective function to derive a phoneme set for second language speech recognition. The authors verify the efficacy of the proposed method using second language speech collected with a translation game type dialogue-based computer assisted language learning (CALL) system. In this paper, the authors examine the performance based on acoustic likelihood, linguistic discrimination ability and integrated objective function for second language speech. Experiments demonstrate the validity of the phoneme set derived by the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a hybrid push/pull streaming scheme to take advantage of both the interval caching-based push method and the mesh-based pull method. When a new peer joins, a mesh-based pull method is adopted to avoid the overhead to reorganize the structure only if all of its potential preceding peers are likely to leave before the end of its playback. Otherwise, an interval caching-based push method is adopted so that the better performance of the push method can be maintained until it completes the playback. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms compared with when either the interval caching-based push method or mesh-based pull method is employed alone.

DT Article
DE processs measurement; system development; case study
AB To identify problems in a software development process, we have been developing an automated measurement tool called TaskPit, which monitors software development tasks such as programming, testing and documentation based on the execution history of software applications. This paper introduces the system requirements, design and implementation of TaskPit; then, presents two real-world case studies applying TaskPit to actual software development. In the first case study, we applied TaskPit to 12 software developers in a certain software development division. As a result, several concerns (to be improved) have been revealed such as (a) a project leader spent too much time on development tasks while he was supposed to be a manager rather than a developer, (b) several developers rarely used e-mails despite the company's instruction to use e-mail as much as possible to leave communication records during development, and (c) several developers wrote too long e-mails to their customers. In the second case study, we have recorded the planned, actual, and self reported time of development tasks. As a result, we found that (d) there were unplanned tasks in more than half of days, and (e) the declared time became closer day by day to the actual time measured by TaskPit. These findings suggest that TaskPit is useful not only for a project manager who is responsible for process monitoring and improvement but also for a developer who wants to improve by him/herself.

AB In these days, we can see digital signages in many places, for example, inside stations or trains with the distribution of attractive promotional video clips. Users can easily get additional information related to such video clips via mobile devices such as smartphone by using some websites for retrieval. However, such retrieval is time-consuming and sometimes leads users to incorrect information. Therefore, it is desirable that the additional information can be directly obtained from the video clips. We implement a suitable digital watermarking method on smartphone to extract watermarks from video clips on signages in real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed method correctly extracts watermarks in a second on smartphone.

TI Fast Live Migration for IO-Intensive VMs with Parallel and Adaptive

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE live migration; virtualization; cloud performance
AB Live migration plays an important role on improving efficiency of cloud data centers by enabling dynamically replacing virtual machines (VMs) without disrupting services running on them. Although many studies have proposed acceleration mechanisms of live migration, IO-intensive VMs still suffer from long total migration time due to a large amount of page cache. Existing studies for this problem either force the guest OS to delete the page cache before a migration, or they do not consider dynamic characteristics of cloud data centers. We propose a parallel and adaptive transfer of page cache for migrating IO-intensive VMs which (1) does not delete the page cache and is still fast by utilizing the storage area network of a data center, and (2) achieves the shortest total migration time without tuning hand-crafted parameters. Experiments showed that our method reduces total migration time of IO-intensive VMs up to 33.9%.

AB Pair-wise testing is an effective test planning technique for finding interaction faults using a small set of test cases. Constraint elicitation is an important process in the pair-wise testing design since constraints determine the test space; however, the constraint elicitation process has not been well studied. It usually requires manual capturing and precise definition of constraints. In this paper, we propose a constraint elicitation process that helps combinatorial test design. Our elicitation process consists of two steps: parameter combination identification and value pair determination. We conduct experiments on some test models, and demonstrate that some extracted rules match constraints and others helps to define constraints.

AB Considering an uncertain multi-objective optimization system with interval coefficients, this letter proposes an interval multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm. In order to improve its performance, a crowding distance measure based on the distance and the overlap degree of intervals, and a method of updating the archive based on the acceptance coefficient of decision-maker, are employed. Finally, results show that our algorithm is capable of generating excellent approximation of the true Pareto front.

AB Ranking as an important task in information systems has many applications, such as document/webpage retrieval, collaborative filtering and advertising. The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in the study of learning to rank as a means to leverage training information in a system. In this paper, we propose a new learning to rank method, i.e. BLM-Rank, which uses a linear function to score samples and models the pairwise preference of samples relying on their scores under a Bayesian framework. A stochastic gradient approach is adopted to maximize the posterior probability in BLM-Rank. For industrial practice, we have also implemented the proposed algorithm on Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). Experimental results on LETOR have demonstrated that the proposed BLM-Rank method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including RankSVM-Struct, RankBoost, AdaRank-NDCG, AdaRank-MAP and ListNet. Moreover, the results have shown that the GPU implementation of the BLM-Rank method is ten-to-eleven times faster than its CPU counterpart in the training phase, and one-to-four times faster in the testing phase.

TI Wavelet Pyramid Based Multi-Resolution Bilateral Motion Estimation for
   Frame Rate Up-Conversion

DE motion-compensated frame rate up-conversion; bilateral motion
   estimation; multi-resolution search; wavelet pyramid
AB The conventional bilateral motion estimation (BME) for motion-compensated frame rate up-conversion (MC-FRUC) can avoid the problem of overlapped areas and holes but usually results in lots of inaccurate motion vectors (MVs) since 1) the MV of an object between the previous and following frames is more likely to have no temporal symmetry with respect to the target block of the interpolated frame and 2) the repetitive patterns existing in video frame lead to the problem of mismatch due to the lack of the interpolated block. In this paper, a new BME algorithm with a low computational complexity is proposed to resolve the above problems. The proposed algorithm incorporates multi-resolution search into BME, since it can easily utilize the MV consistency between two adjacent pyramid levels and spatial neighboring MVs to correct the inaccurate MVs resulting from no temporal symmetry while guaranteeing low computational cost. Besides, the multi-resolution search uses the fast wavelet transform to construct the wavelet pyramid, which not only can guarantee low computational complexity but also can reserve the high-frequency components of image at each level while sub-sampling. The high-frequency components are used to regularize the traditional block matching criterion for reducing the probability of mismatch in BME. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both the objective and subjective quality of the interpolated frame with low computational complexity, and provide the better performance than the existing BME algorithms.

AB Analogy-based software effort estimation has gained a considerable amount of attention in current research and practice. Its excellent estimation accuracy relies on its solution adaptation stage, where an effort estimate is produced from similar past projects. This study proposes a solution adaptation technique named LSA-X that introduces an approach to exploit the potential of productivity factors, i.e., project variables with a high correlation with software productivity, in the solution adaptation stage. The LSA-X technique tailors the exploitation of the productivity factors with a procedure based on the Linear Size Adaptation (LSA) technique. The results, based on 19 datasets show that in circumstances where a dataset exhibits a high correlation coefficient between productivity and a related factor (r = 0.30), the proposed LSA-X technique statistically outperformed (95% confidence) the other 8 commonly used techniques compared in this study. In other circumstances, our results suggest using any linear adaptation technique based on software size to compensate for the limitations of the LSA-X technique.

AB Although many 3D structures have been solved for proteins to date, functions of some proteins remain unknown. To predict protein functions, comparison of local structures of proteins with pre-defined model structures, whose functions have been elucidated, is widely performed. For the comparison, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) has been used as a conventional index. In this work, adaptive deviation was incorporated, along with Bregmann Divergence Regularized Machine, in order to detect analogous local structures with such model structures more effectively than the conventional index.

TI Novel High Performance Scheduling Algorithms for Crosspoint Buffered
   Crossbar Switches

AB The crossbar-based switch fabric is widely used in today's high performance switches, due to its internally nonblocking and simply implementation properties. Usually there are two main switching architectures for crossbar-based switch fabric: internally bufferless crossbar switch and crosspoint buffered crossbar switch. As internally bufferless crossbar switch requires a complex centralized scheduler which limits its scalability to high speeds, crosspoint buffered crossbar switch has gained more attention because of its simpler distributed scheduling algorithm and better switching performance. However, almost all the scheduling algorithms proposed previously for crosspoint buffered crossbar switch either have unsatisfactory scheduling performance under non-uniform traffic patterns or show poor service fairness between input traffic flows. In order to overcome the disadvantages of existing algorithms, in this paper we propose two novel high performance scheduling algorithms named MCQF_RR and IMCQF_RR for crosspoint buffered crossbar switches. Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of input/output ports of the switch. MCQF_RR takes advantage of the combined weight information about queue length and service waiting time of input queues to perform scheduling. In order to further reduce the scheduling complexity and make it feasible for high speed switches, IMCQF_RR uses the compressed queue length information instead of original queue length information to schedule cells in input VOQs. Simulation results show that our novel scheduling algorithms MCQF_RR and IMCQF_RR can demonstrate excellent delay performance comparable to existing high performance scheduling algorithms under both uniform and non-uniform traffic patterns, while maintain good service fairness performance under severe non-uniform traffic patterns.

ID PERCEIVED FOREIGN ACCENT; NONNATIVE SPEECH
AB Recognition of second language (L2) speech is still a challenging task even for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, partly because pronunciation by L2 speakers is usually significantly influenced by the mother tongue of the speakers. The authors previously proposed using a reduced phoneme set (RPS) instead of the canonical one of L2 when the mother tongue of speakers is known, and demonstrated that this reduced phoneme set improved the recognition performance through experiments using English utterances spoken by Japanese. However, the proficiency of L2 speakers varies widely, as does the influence of the mother tongue on their pronunciation. As a result, the effect of the reduced phoneme set is different depending on the speakers' proficiency in L2. In this paper, the authors examine the relation between proficiency of speakers and a reduced phoneme set customized for them. The experimental results are then used as the basis of a novel speech recognition method using a lexicon in which the pronunciation of each lexical item is represented by multiple reduced phoneme sets, and the implementation of a language model most suitable for that lexicon is described. Experimental results demonstrate the high validity of the proposed method.

AB Recently, standard organizations of ATSC, DVB and TTA have been working to design various immersive media broadcasting services such as the hybrid network-based 3D video, UHD video and multiple views. This letter focuses on providing a new synchronization and transport system target decoder (T-STD) model of 3D video distribution based on heterogeneous transmission protocol in a hybrid network environment, where a broadcasting network and broadband (IP) network are combined. On the basis of the experimental results, the proposed technology has been proved to be successfully used as a core element for synchronization and T-STD model in a hybrid network-based 3D broadcasting. It has been also found out that it could be used as a base technique for various IP associated hybrid broadcasting services.

AB The paper proposes an algorithm to expose spliced photographs. Firstly, a graph-based segmentation, which defines a predictor to measure boundary evidence between two neighbor regions, is used to make greedy decision. Then the algorithm gets prediction error image using non-negative linear least-square prediction. For each pair of segmented neighbor regions, the proposed algorithm gathers their statistic features and calculates features of gray level co-occurrence matrix. K-means clustering is applied to create a dictionary, and the vector quantization histogram is taken as the result vector with fixed length. For a tampered image, its noise satisfies Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The proposed method checks the similarity between noise distribution and a zero-mean Gaussian distribution, and follows with the local flatness and texture measurement. Finally, all features are fed to a support vector machine classifier. The algorithm has low computational cost. Experiments show its effectiveness in exposing forgery.

TI Reconstructing Sequential Patterns without Knowing Image Correspondences

DE sequential patterns; multi-view relationship; reconstruction
ID PROJECTION
AB In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D sequential patterns from multiple images without knowing exact image correspondences and without calibrating linear camera sensitivity parameters on intensity. The sequential pattern is defined as a series of colored 3D points. We assume that the series of the points are obtained in multiple images, but the correspondence of individual points is not known among multiple images. For reconstructing sequential patterns, we consider a camera projection model which combines geometric and photometric information of objects. Furthermore, we consider camera projections in the frequency space. By considering the multi-view relationship on the new projection model, we show that the 3D sequential patterns can be reconstructed without knowing exact correspondence of individual image points in the sequential patterns; moreover, the recovered 3D patterns do not suffer from changes in linear camera sensitivity parameters. The efficiency of the proposed method is tested using real images.

AB In recent years, researchers have tried to create unhindered human-computer interaction by giving virtual agents human-like conversational skills. Predicting backchannel feedback for agent listeners has become a novel research hot-spot. The main goal of this paper is to identify appropriate features and methods for backchannel prediction in Mandarin conversations. Firstly, multimodal Mandarin conversations are recorded for the analysis of backchannel behaviors. In order to eliminate individual difference in the original face-to-face conversations, more backchannels from different listeners are gathered together. These data confirm that backchannels occurring in the speakers' pauses form a vast majority in Mandarin conversations. Both prosodic and visual features are used in backchannel prediction. Four types of models based on the speakers' pauses are built by using support vector machine classifiers. An evaluation of the pause-based prediction model has shown relatively high accuracy in consideration of the optional nature of backchannel feedback. Finally, the results of the subjective evaluation validate that the conversations performed between humans and virtual listeners using backchannels predicted by the proposed models is more unhindered compared to other backchannel prediction methods.

DE image segmentation; Gaussian processes; mixture models
AB In image segmentation, finite mixture modeling has been widely used. In its simplest form, the spatial correlation among neighboring pixels is not taken into account, and its segmentation results can be largely deteriorated by noise in images. We propose a spatially correlated mixture model in which the mixing proportions of finite mixture models are governed by a set of underlying functions defined on the image space. The spatial correlation among pixels is introduced by putting a Gaussian process prior on the underlying functions. We can set the spatial correlation rather directly and flexibly by choosing the covariance function of the Gaussian process prior. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by experiments with synthetic and real images.

AB The simplicity is a type of measurement that represents visual simplicity of a signal, regardless of its amplitude and frequency variation. We propose an algorithm that can detect major components of heart sound using Gaussian regression to the smoothed simplicity profile of a heart sound signal. The weight and spread of the Gaussians are used as features to discriminate cardiac murmurs from major components of a heart sound signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very promising for robust and accurate detection of major heart sound components as well as cardiac murmurs.

ID CLASSIFICATION; TEXTURE
AB This paper proposes a novel image classification scheme for cloth pattern recognition. The rotation and scale invariant delta-HOG (DHOG)-based descriptor and the entire recognition process using random ferns with this descriptor are proposed independent from pose and scale changes. These methods consider maximun orientation and various radii of a circular patch window for fast and efficient classification even when cloth patches are rotated and the scale is changed. It exhibits good performance in cloth pattern recognition experiments. It found a greater number of similar cloth patches than dense-SIFT in 20 tests out of a total of 36 query tests. In addition, the proposed method is much faster than dense-SIFT in both training and testing; its time consumption is decreased by 57.7% in training and 41.4% in testing. The proposed method, therefore, is expected to contribute to real-time cloth searching service applications that update vast numbers of cloth images posted on the Internet.

DE motion segmentation; graph clustering; motion preference set
AB In this paper, we present a new algorithm for fast online motion segmentation with low time complexity. Feature points in each input frame of an image stream are represented as a spatial neighbor graph. Then, the affinities for each point pair on the graph, as edge weights, are computed through our effective motion analysis based on multi-temporal intervals. Finally, these points are optimally segmented by agglomerative hierarchical clustering combined with normalized modularity maximization. Through experiments on publicly available datasets, we show that the proposed method operates in real time with almost linear time complexity, producing segmentation results comparable with those of recent state-of-the-art methods.

   Descriptors

DE feature matching; partial comparison; descriptor rearrangement; entropy
   analysis; SURF; coarse-to-fine approach
AB Speeded up robust features (SURF) can detect/describe scale-and rotation-invariant features at high speed by relying on integral images for image convolutions. However, the time taken for matching SURF descriptors is still long, and this has been an obstacle for use in real-time applications. In addition, the matching time further increases in proportion to the number of features and the dimensionality of the descriptor. Therefore, we propose a fast matching method that rearranges the elements of SURF descriptors based on their entropies, divides SURF descriptors into sub-descriptors, and sequentially and analytically matches them to each other. Our results show that the matching time could be reduced by about 75% at the expense of a small drop in accuracy.

AB In this paper, we evaluate a method of agile software development for carrier Cloud service platform development. It is generally said that agile software development is suitable for small-scale development, but we adopt it for the development which has more than 30 members. We attempted to enable automatic regression tests for each iteration when we adopted agile software development, so that we could start our Cloud service sufficiently fast. We compared and evaluated software reliability growth curves, regression test efforts and bug causes with waterfall development.

AB The applicability of at-speed scan-based logic built-in self-test (BIST) is being severely challenged by excessive capture power that may cause erroneous test responses even for good circuits. Different from conventional low-power BIST, this paper is the first to explicitly focus on achieving capture power safety with a novel and practical scheme, called capture-power-safe logic BIST (CPS-LBIST). The basic idea is to identify all possibly-erroneous test responses caused by excessive capture power and use the well-known approach of masking (bit-masking, slice-masking, vector-masking) to block them from reaching the multiple-input signature register (MISR). Experiments with large benchmark circuits and a large industrial circuit demonstrate that CPS-LBIST can achieve capture power safety with negligible impact on test quality and circuit overhead.

AB Understanding the structure and evolution of spatial-temporal networks is crucial for different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. As location based technologies are pervasively used in our daily life, large amount of sensing data has brought the opportunities to study human activities and city dynamics. Ubiquitous cell phones can be such a sensor to analyze the social connection and boundaries of geographical regions. In this paper, we exploit user mobility based on large-scale mobile phone records to study urban areas. We collect the call data records from 1 million anonymous subscribers of 8 weeks and study the user mobility flux between different regions. First we construct the urban areas as a spatial network and use modularity detection algorithm to study the intrinsic connection between map areas. Second, another generative model which is widely used in linguistic context is adopted to explore the functions of regions. Based on mobile call records we are able to derive the partitions which match boundaries of the administrative districts. Our results can also catch the dynamics of urban area as the basis for city planning and policy making.

AB A build system converts source code, libraries and other data into executable programs by orchestrating the execution of compilers and other toots. The whole building process is managed by a software build system, such as Make, Ant, CMake, Maven, Scons, and QMake. Many studies have investigated bugs and fixes in several systems. but to our best knowledge, none focused on bugs in build systems. One significant feature of software build systems is that they should work on various platforms, i.e., various operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux), various development environments (e.g., Eclipse, Visual Studio), and various programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, C#), so the study of software build systems deserves special consideration. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on bugs in software build systems. We analyze four software build systems, Ant, Maven, CMake and QMake, which are four typical and widely-used software build systems, and can be used to build Java, C, C++ systems. We investigate their bug database and code repositories, randomly sample a set of bug reports and their fixes (800 bugs reports totally, and 199, 250, 200, and 151 bug reports for Ant, Maven, CMake and QMake, respectively), and manually assign them into various categories. We find that 21.35% of the bugs belong to the external interface category, 18.23% of the bugs belong to the logic category, and 12.86% of the bugs belong to the configuration category. We also investigate the relationship between bug categories and bug severities, bug fixing time, and number of bug comments.

AB Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). since they were introduced, have been successfully used to solve discrete optimization problems and hence proven to be an effective methodology for discrete optimization. To enhance the applicability of EDAs, researchers started to integrate EDAs with discretization methods such that the EDAs designed for discrete variables can be made capable of solving continuous optimization problems. In order to further our understandings of the collaboration between EDAs and discretization methods, in this paper, we propose a quality measure of discretization methods for EDAs. We then utilize the proposed quality measure to analyze three discretization methods: fixed-width histogram (FWH). fixed-height histogram (FHH), and greedy random split (GRS). Analytical measurements are obtained for FHH and FWH, and sampling measurements are conducted for FHH. FWH, and GRS. Furthermore, we integrate Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), a representative EDA, with the three discretization methods to conduct experiments and to observe the performance difference. A good agreement is reached between the discretization quality measurements and the numerical optimization results. The empirical results show that the proposed quality measure can be considered as an indicator of the suitability for a discretization method to work with EDAs.

AB Toward the actualization of an automatic navigation system for fetoscopic tracheal occlusion (FETO) surgery, this paper proposes a 3D ultrasound (US) calibration-based approach that can locate the fetal facial surface, oral cavity, and airways by a registration between a 3D fetal model and 3D US images. The proposed approach consists of an offline process and online process. The offline process first reconstructs the 3D fetal model with the anatomies of the oral cavity and airways. Then, a point-based 3D US calibration system based on real-time 3D US images, an electromagnetic (EM) tracking device, and a novel cones' phantom, computes the matrix that transforms the 3D US image space into the world coordinate system. In the online process, by scanning the mother's body with a 3D US probe, 3D US images containing the fetus are obtained. The fetal facial surface extracted from the 3D US images is registered to the 3D fetal model using an ICP-based (iterative closest point) algorithm and the calibration matrices, so that the fetal facial surface as well as the oral cavity and airways are located. The results indicate that the 3D US calibration system achieves an FRE (fiducial registration error) of 1.49 +/- 0.44 mm and a TRE (target registration error) of 1.81 +/- 0.56 mm by using 24 fiducial points from two US volumes. A mean TRE of 1.55 +/- 0.46 mm is also achieved for measuring location accuracy of the 3D fetal facial surface extracted from 3D US images by 14 target markers, and mean location errors of 2.51 +/- 0.47 mm and 3.04 +/- 0.59 mm are achieved for indirectly measuring location accuracy of the pharynx and the entrance of the trachea, respectively, which satisfy the requirement of the FETO surgery.

TI New Metrics for Prioritized Interaction Test Suites
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE combinatorial interaction testing; test case prioritization; prioritized
   interaction test suite (or interaction test sequence); interaction
   coverage; metrics
AB Combinatorial interaction testing has been well studied in recent years, and has been widely applied in practice. It generally aims at generating an effective test suite (an interaction test suite) in order to identify faults that are caused by parameter interactions. Due to some constraints in practical applications (e.g. limited testing resources), for example in combinatorial interaction regression testing, prioritized interaction test suites (called interaction test sequences) are often employed. Consequently, many strategies have been proposed to guide the interaction test suite prioritization. It is, therefore, important to be able to evaluate the different interaction test sequences that have been created by different strategies. A well-known metric is the Average Percentage of Combinatorial Coverage (shortly APCC(lambda)), which assesses the rate of interaction coverage of a strength lambda (level of interaction among parameters) covered by a given interaction test sequence S. However, APCC(lambda) has two drawbacks: firstly, it has two requirements (that all test cases in S be executed, and that all possible lambda-wise parameter value combinations be covered by S); and secondly, it can only use a single strength lambda (rather than multiple strengths) to evaluate the interaction test sequence which means that it is not a comprehensive evaluation. To overcome the first drawback, we propose an enhanced metric Normalized APCC(lambda) (NAPCC) to replace the APCC(lambda). Additionally, to overcome the second drawback, we propose three new metrics: the Average Percentage of Strengths Satisfied (APSS); the Average Percentage of Weighted Multiple Interaction Coverage (APWMIC); and the Normalized APWMIC (NAPWMIC). These metrics comprehensively assess a given interaction test sequence by considering different interaction coverage at different strengths. Empirical studies show that the proposed metrics can be used to distinguish different interaction test sequences, and hence can be used to compare different test prioritization strategies.

AB In this paper, we propose a bitstream-level noise cancellation method for playback applications of damaged video. Most analog video data such as movies, news and historical research videos are now stored in a digital format after a series of conversion processes that include analog-to-digital conversion and compression. In many cases, noise such as blotches and line scratching remaining in analog media are not removed during the conversion process. On the other hand, noise is propagated in the compression stage because most media compression technologies use predictive coding. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently remove or reduce the artifacts caused by noise as much as possible. In some cases, the video data with historical values are to be preserved without correcting the noise in order not to lose any important information resulting from the noise, removal process. However, playback applications of such video data still need to undergo a noise reduction process to ensure picture quality for public viewing. The proposed algorithm identifies the candidate noise blocks at the bitstream-level to directly provide a noise reduction process while decoding the bitstream. Throughout the experimental results, we confirm the efficiency of the proposed method by showing RR and PR values of around 70 percent.

AB KCipher-2 is a word-oriented stream cipher and an ISOJEC 18033 standard. It is listed as a CRYPTREC cryptographic algorithm for Japanese governmental use. It consists of two feedback shift registers and a non-linear function. The size of each register in KCipher-2 is 32 bits and the non-linear function mainly applies 32-bit operations. Therefore, it can be efficiently implemented as software. SNOW-family stream ciphers are also word-oriented stream ciphers, and their high performance has already been demonstrated. We propose optimised implementations of KCipher-2 and compare their performance to that of the SNOW-family and other eSTREAM portfolios. The fastest algorithm is SNOW 2.0 and KCipher-2 is the second fastest despite the complicated irregular clocking mechanism. However, KCipher-2 is the fastest of the feasible algorithms, as SNOW 2.0 has been shown to have a security flaw. We also optimise the hardware implementation for the Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and show two implementations. The first implementation is a rather straightforward optimisation and achieves 16,153 Mbps with 732 slices. In the second implementation, we duplicate the non-linear function using the structural advantage of KCipher-2 and we achieve 17,354 Mbps with 813 slices. Our implementation of KCipher-2 is around three times faster than those of the SNOW-family and efficiency, which is evaluated by "Throughput/Area (Mbps/slice)", is 3.6-times better than that of SNOW 2.0 and 8.5-times better than that of SNOW 3G. These syntheses are performed using Xilinx ISE version 12.4.

AB Soccer player tracking and labeling suffer from the similar appearance of the players in the same team, especially in long-shot scenes where the faces and the numbers of the players are too blurry to identify. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-player tracking system. The tracking system takes the detection responses of a human detector as inputs. To realize real-time player detection, we generate a spatial proposal to minimize the scanning scope of the detector. The tracking system utilizes the discriminative appearance models trained using the online Boosting method to reduce data-association ambiguity caused by the appearance similarity of the players. We also propose to build an online learned player recognition model which can be embedded in the tracking system to approach online player recognition and labeling in tracking applications for long-shot scenes by two stages. At the first stage, to build the model, we utilize the fast k-means clustering method instead of classic k-means clustering to build and update a visual word vocabulary in an efficient online manner, using the informative descriptors extracted from the training samples drawn at each time step of multi-player tracking. The first stage finishes when the vocabulary is ready. At the second stage, given the obtained visual word vocabulary, an incremental vector quantization strategy is used to recognize and label each tracked player. We also perform importance recognition validation to avoid mistakenly recognizing an outlier, namely, people we do not need to recognize, as a player. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the long-shot video clips of a real soccer game video demonstrate that, the proposed player recognition model performs much better than some state-of-the-art online learned models, and our tracking system also performs quite effectively even under very complicated situations.

AB Recently Peer-to-Peer Content Pelivery Networks (P2P CDNs) have attracted considerable attention as a cost-effective way to disseminate digital contents to paid users in a scalable and dependable manner. However, due to its peer-to-peer nature, it faces threat from "colluders" who paid for the contents but illegally share them with unauthorized peers. This means that the detection of colluders is a crucial task for P2P CDNs to preserve the right of contents holders and paid users. In this paper, we propose two colluder detection schemes for P2P CDNs. The first scheme is based on the reputation collected from all peers participating in the network and the second scheme improves the quality of colluder identification by using a technique which is well known in the field of system level diagnosis. The performance of the schemes is evaluated by simulation. The simulation results indicate that even when 10% of authorized peers are colluders, our schemes identify all colluders without causing misidentifications.

DE window memory layout scheme (WMLS); alternate row-wise/column-wise
   matrix access; SDRAM; GPU; FPGA
AB The effective bandwidth of the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) for the alternate row-wise/column-wise matrix access (AR/CMA) mode, which is a basic characteristic in scientific and engineering applications, is very low. Therefore, we propose the window memory layout scheme (WMLS), which is a matrix layout scheme that does not require transposition, for AR/CMA applications. This scheme maps one row of a logical matrix into a rectangular memory window of the DRAM to balance the bandwidth of the row- and column-wise matrix access and to increase the DRAM 10 bandwidth. The optimal window configuration is theoretically analyzed to minimize the total number of no-data-visit operations of the DRAM. Different WMLS implementationsare presented according to the memory structure of field-programmable gata array (FPGA), CPU, and GPU platforms. Experimental results show that the proposed WMLS can significantly improve DRAM bandwidth for AR/CMA applications. achieved speedup factors of 1.6x and 2.0x are achieved for the general-purpose CPU and GPU platforms, respectively. For the FPGA platform, the WMLS DRAM controller is custom. The maximum bandwidth for the AR/CMA mode reaches 5.94 GB/s, which is a 73.6% improvement compared with that of the traditional row-wise access mode. Finally, we apply WMLS scheme for Chirp Scaling SAR application, comparing with the traditional access approach, the maximum speedup factors of 4.73X, 1.33X and 1.56X can be achieved for FPGA, CPU and GPU platform, respectively.

AB This paper presents a GPU (Graphics Processing Units) implementation of dynamic programming for the optimal polygon triangulation. Recently, GPUs can be used for general purpose parallel computation. Users can develop parallel programs running on GPUs using programming architecture called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) provided by NVIDIA. The optimal polygon triangulation problem for a convex polygon is an optimization problem to find a triangulation with minimum total weight. It is known that this problem for a convex n-gon can be solved using the dynamic programming technique in O(n(3)) time using a work space of size O(n(2)). In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel implementation of this O(n(3))-time algorithm on the GPU. In our implementation, we have used two new ideas to accelerate the dynamic programming. The first idea (adaptive granularity) is to partition the dynamic programming algorithm into many sequential kernel calls of CUDA, and to select the best parameters for the size and the number of blocks for each kernel call. The second idea (sliding and mirroring arrangements) is to arrange the working data for coalesced access of the global memory in the GPU to minimize the memory access overhead. Our implementation using these two ideas solves the optimal polygon triangulation problem for a convex 8192-gon in 5.57 seconds on the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680, while a conventional CPU implementation runs in 1939.02 seconds. Thus, our GPU implementation attains a speedup factor of 348.02.

ID PREDICTION
AB An improved genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the structure of (C-60)(N) (N <= 25) fullerene clusters with the lowest energy. First, crossover with variable precision, realized by introducing the hamming distance, is developed to provide a faster search mechanism. Second, the bit string mutation and feedback mutation are incorporated to maintain the diversity in the population. The interaction between C-60 molecules is described by the Pacheco and Ramalho potential derived from first-principles calculations. We compare the performance of the Improved GA (IGA) with that of the Standard GA (SGA). The numerical and graphical results verify that the proposed approach is faster and more robust than the SGA. The second finite differential of the total energy shows that the (C-60)(N) clusters with N = 7, 13, 22 are particularly stable. Performance with the lowest energy is achieved in this work.

AB This paper studies the static mapping of multiple applications on embedded many-core SoCs. The mapping techniques proposed in this paper take into account both inter-application and intra-application parallelism in order to fully utilize the potential parallelism of the many-core architecture. Two approaches are proposed for static mapping: one approach is based on integer linear programming and the other is based on a greedy algorithm. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

TI Neighborhood Level Error Control Codes for Multi-Level Cell Flash
   Memories
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE Integer codes; asymmetric symbol error; generalization; NAND Flash
   memory; neighborhood level error
AB NAND Flash memories are widely used as data storages today. The memories are not intrinsically error free because they are affected by several physical disturbances. Technology scaling and introduction of multi-level cell (MLC) has improved data density, but it has made error effect more significant. Error control codes (ECC) are essential to improve reliability of NAND Flash memories. Efficiency of codes depends on error characteristic of systems, and codes are required to be designed to reflect this characteristic. In MLC Flash memories, errors tend to direct values to neighborhood. These errors are a class of M-ary asymmetric symbol error. Some codes which reflect the asymmetric property were proposed. They are designed to correct only 1 level shift errors because almost all of the errors in the memories are in such errors. But technology scaling, increase of program/erase (P/E) cycles, and MLC storing the large number of bits can cause multiple-level shift. This paper proposes single error control codes which can correct an error of more than 1 levels shift. Because the number of levels to be corrected is selectable, we can fit it into noise magnitude. Furthermore, it is possible to add error detecting function for error of the larger shift. Proposed codes are equivalent to a conventional integer codes, which can correct 1 level shift, on a certain parameter. Therefore, the codes are said to be generalization of conventional integer codes. Evaluation results show information lengths to respective check symbol lengths are larger than nonbinary Hamming codes and other M-ary asymmetric symbol error correcting codes.

TI Selective Check of Data-Path for Effective Fault Tolerance
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE low power; fault-tolerant computing; FU array
AB Nowadays, fault tolerance has been playing a progressively important role in covering increasing soft/hard error rates in electronic devices that accompany the advances of process technologies. Research shows that wear-out faults have a gradual onset, starting with a timing fault and then eventually leading to a permanent fault. Error detection is thus a required function to maintain execution correctness. Currently, however, many highly dependable methods to cover permanent faults are commonly over-designed by using very frequent checking, due to lack of awareness of the fault possibility in circuits used for the pending executions. In this research, to address the over-checking problem, we introduce a metric for permanent defects, as operation defective probability (ODP), to quantitatively instruct the check operations being placed only at critical positions. By using this selective checking approach, we can achieve a near-100% dependability by having about 53% less check operations, as compared to the ideal reliable method, which performs exhaustive checks to guarantee a zero-error propagation. By this means, we are able to reduce 21.7% power consumption by avoiding the non-critical checking inside the over-designed approach.

TI Affine Transformations for Communication and Reconfiguration
   Optimization of Mapping Loop Nests on CGRAs
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE reconfigurable computing; loop transformation; polyhedra model;

AB A coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) is typically hybrid architecture, which is composed of a reconfigurable processing unit (RPU) and a host microprocessor. Many computation-intensive kernels (e.g., loop nests) are often mapped onto RPUs to speed up the execution of programs. Thus, mapping optimization of loop nests is very important to improve the performance of CGRA. Processing element (PE) utilization rate, communication volume and reconfiguration cost are three crucial factors for the performance of RPUs. Loop transformations can affect these three performance influencing factors greatly, and would be of much significance when mapping loops onto RPUs. In this paper, a joint loop transformation approach for RPUs is proposed, where the PE utilization rate, communication cost and reconfiguration cost are under a joint consideration. Our approach could be integrated into compilers for CGRAs to improve the operating performance. Compared with the communication-minimal approach, experimental results show that our scheme can improve 5.8% and 13.6% of execution time on motion estimation (ME) and partial differential equation (PDE) solvers kernels, respectively. Also, run-time complexity is acceptable for the practical cases.

AB This paper presents a novel topic modeling (TM) approach for discovering meaningful topics for Web APIs, which is a potential dimensionality reduction way for efficient and effective classification, retrieval, organization, and management of numerous APIs. We exploit the possibility of conducting TM on multi-labeled APIs by combining a supervised TM (known as Labeled LDA) with ontology. Experiments conducting on real-world API data set show that the proposed method outperforms standard Labeled LDA with an average gain of 7.0% in measuring quality of the generated topics. In addition, we also evaluate the similarity matching between topics generated by our method and standard Labeled LDA, which demonstrates the significance of incorporating ontology.

AB This paper deals with delay faults on clock lines assuming the launch-on-capture test. In this realistic fault model, the amount of delay at the FF driven by the faulty clock line is such that the scan shift operation can perform correctly even in the presence of a fault, but during the system clock operation, capturing functional value(s) at faulty FF(s), i.e. FF(s) driven by the clock with delay, is delayed and correct value(s) may not be captured. We developed a fault simulator that can handle such faults and using this simulator we investigate the relation between the duration of the delay and the difficulty of detecting clock delay faults in the launch-on-capture test. Next, we propose test generation methods for detecting clock delay faults that affect a single or two FFs. Experimental results for benchmark circuits are given in order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TI Classification of Pneumoconiosis on HRCT Images for Computer-Aided

DT Article
DE pneumoconiosis; computer-aided diagnosis; HRCT; Hessian matrix;

AB This paper describes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method to classify pneumoconiosis on HRCT images. In Japan, the pneumoconiosis is divided into 4 types according to the density of nodules: Type 1 (no nodules), Type 2 (few small nodules), Type 3-a (numerous small nodules) and Type 3-b (numerous small nodules and presence of large nodules). Because most pneumoconiotic nodules are small-sized and irregular-shape, only few nodules can be detected by conventional nodule extraction methods, which would affect the classification of pneumoconiosis. To improve the performance of nodule extraction, we proposed a filter based on analysis the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix. The classification of pneumoconiosis is performed in the following steps: Firstly the large-sized nodules were extracted and cases of type 3-b were recognized. Secondly, for the rest cases, the small nodules were detected and false positives were eliminated. Thirdly we adopted a bag-of-features-based method to generate input vectors for a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally cases of type 1,2 and 3-a were classified. The proposed method was evaluated on 175 HRCT scans of 112 subjects. The average accuracy of classification is 90.6%. Experimental result shows that our method would be helpful to classify pneumoconiosis on HRCT.

DE distributed compiler; remote linking; compiler
AB The size and complexity of software in computer systems and even in consumer electronics is drastically and continuously increasing, thus increasing the compilation time. For example, the compilation time for building some of mobile phones' platform software takes several hours. In order to reduce the compilation time, this paper proposes a Distributed Scalable Compilation Tool, called DiSCo where full compilation passes such as preprocessing, compilation, and even linking are performed at remote machines, i.e. in parallel. To the best of our knowledge DiSCo is the first distributed compiler to support complete distributed processing in all the compilation passes. We use an extensive dependency analysis in parsing compilation commands for exploiting higher command-level parallelism, and we apply a file caching method and a network-drive protocol for reducing the remote compilation overhead and simplifying the implementation. Lastly, we minimize load imbalance and remote machine management overhead with our heuristic static scheduling method by predicting compilation time and considering the overheads invoked by the compilation process. Our evaluation using four large mobile applications and eight GNU applications shows that the performance of DiSCo is scalable and the performance is close to a profile scheduling.

AB In this paper, we propose an improved seam merging method for content-aware image resizing. This method merges a two-pixel-width seam element into one new pixel in image reduction and inserts a new pixel between the two pixels in image enlargement. To preserve important contents and structure, our method uses energy terms associated with importance and structure. Our method preserve the main structures by using a cartoon version of the original image when calculating the structure energy. In addition, we introduce a new energy term to suppress the distortion generated by excessive reduction or enlargement in iterated merger or insertion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can produce satisfactory results in both image reduction and enlargement.

DE face recognition; illumination normalization; logarithmic total

AB In this letter, we propose an extension to the classical logarithmic total variation (LTV) model for face recognition under variant illumination conditions. LTV treats all facial areas with the same regularization parameters, which inevitably results in the loss of useful facial details and is harmful for recognition tasks. To address this problem, we propose to assign the regularization parameters which balance the large-scale (illumination) and small-scale (reflectance) components in a spatially adaptive scheme. Face recognition experiments on both Extended Yale B and the large-scale FERET databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Entity is an important information carrier in Web pages. Users would like to directly get a list of relevant entities instead of a list of documents when they submit a query to the search engine. So the research of related entity finding (REF) is a meaningful work. In this paper we investigate the most important task of REF: Entity Ranking The wrong-type entities which don't belong to the target-entity type will pollute the ranking result. We propose a novel method to filter wrong-type entities. We focus on the acquisition of seed entities and automatically extracting the common Wikipedia categories of target-entity type. Also we demonstrate how to filter wrong-type entities using the proposed model. The experimental results show our method can filter wrong-type entities effectively and improve the results of entity ranking.

AB In this paper, we propose a virtualization architecture for a multi-core embedded system to provide more system reliability and security while maintaining performance and without introducing additional special hardware supports or implementing a complex protection mechanism in the virtualization layer. Embedded systems, especially consumer electronics, have often used virtualization. Virtualization is not a new technique, as there are various uses for both GPOS (General Purpose Operating System) and RTOS (Real Time Operating System). The surge of the multicore platforms in embedded systems also helps consolidate the virtualization system for better performance and lower power consumption. Embedded virtualization design usually uses two approaches. The first is to use the traditional VMM, but it is too complicated for use in the embedded environment without additional special hardware.support. The other approach uses the microkernel, which imposes a modular design. The guest systems, however, would suffer from considerable modifications in this approach, as the microkernel allows guest systems to run in the user space. For some RTOSes and their applications originally running in the kernel space, this second approach is more difficult to use because those codes use many privileged instructions. To achieve better reliability and keep the virtualization layer design lightweight, this work uses a common hardware component adopted in multi-core embedded processors. In most embedded platforms, vendors provide additional on-chip local memory for each physical core, and these local memory areas are only private to their cores. By taking advantage of this memory architecture, we can mitigate the above-mentioned problems at once. We choose to re-map the virtualization layer's program on the local memory, called SPUMONE, which runs all guest systems in the kernel space. Doing so, it can provide additional reliability and security for the entire system because the SPUMONE design in a multi-core platform has each instance installed on a separate processor core. This design differs from traditional virtualization layer design, and the content of each SPUMONE is inaccessible to the others. We also achieve this goal without adding overhead to the overall performance.

AB In H.264/AVC intra frame coding, the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is employed to select the optimal coding mode to achieve the minimum rate-distortion cost. Due to a large number of combinations of coding modes, the computational burden of Rate distortion optimization (RDO) becomes extremely high in intra prediction. In this paper, we proposed an efficient selective intra block size decision (SIB) that selects the appropriate block size for intra prediction, further proposed fast intra prediction algorithm reduces a number of modes required for RDO that significantly reduces the encoder complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed fast mode decision algorithm reduces the encoding time by up to 68% with negligible video quality degradation.

AB Compressing a JPEG image twice will greatly decrease the values of some of its DCT coefficients. This effect can be easily detected by statistics methods. To defend this forensic method, we establish a model to evaluate the security and image quality influenced by the re-compression. Base on the model, an optimized adjustment of the DCT coefficients is achieved by Genetic Algorithm. Results show that the traces of double compression are removed while preserving image quality.

DE XPath query minimization; query optimization
AB Considerable effort has been devoted to minimizing XPath queries under the assumption that the minimal query is faster than the original query. However, little attention has been paid to the validity of the assumption. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis on the effectiveness of XPath query minimization and present an extensive experimental evaluation on the effectiveness using six publicly available XQuery engines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work done towards this objective. Experiments on real and synthetic data sets show that although the assumption is valid for some cases, the performance of the minimal query is often lower than or almost equal to that of the original query.

DE keypoint matching; viewpoint estimation; randomized trees
AB This paper proposes a high-precision, high-speed keypoint matching method using two-stage randomized trees (RTs). The keypoint classification uses conventional RTs for high-precision, real-time keypoint matching. However, the wide variety of view transformations for templates expressed by RTs make it diffidult to achieve high-precision classification for all transformations with a single RTs. To solve this problem, the proposed method classifies-the template view transformations in the first stage and then, in the second stage, classifies the keypoints using the RTs that corresponds to each of the view transformations classified in the first stage. Testing demonstrated that the proposed method is 88.5% more precise than SIFT, and 63.5% more precise than using conventional RTs for images in which the viewpoint of the object is rotated by 70 degrees. We have also shown that the proposed method supports real-time keypoint matching at 12 fps.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB This paper describes a technique for overcoming the model shrinkage problem in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which allows application developers and users to control the model size with less degradation of accuracy. Recently, models for ASR systems tend to be large and this can constitute a bottleneck for developers and users without special knowledge of ASR with respect to introducing the ASR function. Specifically, discriminative language models (DLMs) are usually designed in a high-dimensional parameter space, although DLMs have gained increasing attention as an approach for improving recognition accuracy. Our proposed method can be applied to linear models including DLMs, in which the score of an input sample is given by the inner product of its features and the model parameters, but our proposed method can shrink models in an easy computation by obtaining simple statistics, which are square sums of feature values appearing in a data set. Our experimental results show that our proposed method can shrink a DLM with little degradation in accuracy and perform properly whether or not the data for obtaining the statistics are the same as the data for training the model.

AB Despite the benefits of the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm, it becomes computationally inefficient when applied to high-dimensional data. In this letter, a parallel implementation of the GK algorithm on the GPU with CUDA is proposed. Using an optimized matrix multiplication algorithm with fast access to shared memory, the CUDA version achieved a maximum 240-fold speedup over the single-CPU version.

TI Two-Stage Block-Based Whitened Principal Component Analysis with
   Application to Single Sample Face Recognition
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

   whitening transform; K-Nearest Neighbors

AB In the task of face recognition, a challenging issue is the one sample problem, namely, there is only one training sample per person. Principal component analysis (PCA) seeks a low-dimensional representation that maximizes the global scatter of the training samples, and thus is suitable for one sample problem. However, standard PCA is sensitive to the outliers and emphasizes more on the relatively distant sample pairs, which implies that the close samples belonging to different classes tend to be merged together. In this paper, we propose two-stage block-based whitened PCA (TS-BWPCA) to address this problem. For a specific probe image, in the first stage, we seek the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NNs) in the whitened PCA space and thus exclude most of samples which are distant to the probe. In the second stage, we maximize the "local" scatter by performing whitened PCA on the K nearest samples, which could explore the most discriminative information for similar classes. Moreover, block-based scheme is incorporated to address the small sample problem. This two-stage process is actually a coarse-to-fine scheme that can maximize both global and local scatter, and thus overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings of PCA. Experimental results on FERET face database show that our proposed algorithm is better than several representative approaches.

TI Fast AdaBoost-Based Face Detection System on a Dynamically Coarse Grain
   Reconfigurable Architecture

DT Article

ID PARALLEL
AB An AdaBoost-based face detection system is proposed, on a Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) named "REMUS-II". Our work is quite distinguished from previous ones in three aspects. First, a new hardware-software partition method is proposed and the whole face detection system is divided into several parallel tasks implemented on two Reconfigurable Processing Units (RPU) and one micro Processors Unit (mu PU) according to their relationships. These tasks communicate with each other by a mailbox mechanism. Second, a strong classifier is treated as a smallest phase of the detection system, and every phase needs to be executed by these tasks in order. A phase of Haar classifier is dynamically mapped onto a Reconfigurable Cell Array (RCA) only when needed, and it's quite different from traditional Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) methods in which all the classifiers are fabricated statically. Third, optimized data and configuration word pre-fetch mechanisms are employed to improve the whole system performance. Implementation results show that our approach under 200 MHz clock rate can process up-to 17 frames per second on VGA size images, and the detection rate is over 95%. Our system consumes 194 mW, and the die size of fabricated chip is 23 mm(2) using TSMC 65 nm standard cell based technology. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first implementation of the cascade Haar classifier algorithm on a dynamically CGRA platform presented in the literature.

AB The description and analysis of emergence in complex adaptive system has recently become a topic of great interest in the field of systems. and lots of ideas and methods have been proposed. A Sign-based model of Stigmergy is proposed in this paper. Stigmergy is widely used in complex systems. We pick up "Sign" as a key notion to understand it. A definition of "Sign" is given, which reveals the Sign's nature and exploit the significations and relationships carried by the "Sign". Then, a Sign-based model of Stigmergy is consequently developed, which captures the essential characteristics of Stigmergy. The basic architecture of Stigmergy as well as its constituents are presented and then discussed. The syntax and operational semantics of Stigmergy configurations are given. We illustrate the methodology of analyzing emergence in CAS by using our model.

DE visual signal reliability measure; Gaussian fuzzy membership function;

AB In this paper, a novel visual signal reliability (VSR) measure is proposed to consider video degradation at the signal level in audiovisual speaker identification (AVSI). The VSR estimation is formulated using a Gaussian fuzzy membership function (GFMF) to measure lighting variations. The variance parameters of GFMF are optimized in order to maximize the performance of the overall AVSI. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the score-based reliability measuring technique.

ID LINGUISTIC MODELS
AB This paper studies the design of Cascade Granular Neural Networks (CGNN) for human-centric systems. In contrast to typical rule-based systems encountered in fuzzy modeling, the proposed method consists of two-phase development for CGNN. First, we construct a Granular Neural Network (GNN) which could be treated as a preliminary design. Next, all modeling discrepancies are compensated by a second GNN with a collection of rules that become attached to the regions of the input space where the error is localized. These granular networks are constructed by building a collection of user-centric information granules through Context-based Fuzzy c-Means (CFCM) clustering. Finally, the experimental results on two examples reveal that the proposed approach shows good performance in comparison with the previous works.

ID ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
AB This paper proposes a method for using an accelerometer, microphone, and GPS in a mobile phone to recognize the movement of the user. Past attempts at identifying the movement associated with riding on a bicycle, train, bus or car and common human movements like standing still, walking or running have had problems with poor accuracy due to factors such as sudden changes in vibration or times when the vibrations resembled those for other types of movement. Moreover, previous methods have had problems with has the problem of high power consumption because of the sensor processing load. The proposed method aims to avoid these problems by estimating the reliability of the inference result, and by combining two inference modes to decrease the power consumption. Field trials demonstrate that our method achieves 90% or better average accuracy for the seven types of movement listed above. Shaka's power saving functionality enables us to extend the battery life of a mobile phone to over 100 hours while our estimation algorithm is running in the background. Furthermore, this paper uses experimental results to show the trade-off between accuracy and latency when estimating user activity.

AB In our previous project, an XML-based authoring tool was provided for teachers to script multimedia teaching material with animated agents, and a stand-alone learning system was designed for students to display the material and interact with animated agents. We also provided evidence that the authoring tool and learning system in computer-assisted learning systems successfully enhances learning performance. The aim of this study is to continue the previous project, to develop a Web-based multimedia learning system that presents materials and an animated agent on a Web browser. The Web-based multimedia learning system can provide an opportunity for students to engage in independent learning or review of school course work. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of this learning system, it was applied to one elementary school. An experimental material, 'Road Traffic Safety', was presented in two learning systems: a Web-based PowerPoint learning system and a Web-based multimedia learning system. The experiment was carried out in two classes that had a total of thirty-one 3rd-grade students. The results suggest that using our authoring tool in a Web-based learning system can improve learning, and in particular, enhance learners' problem-solving ability. Students with higher achievement on the post-test showed better comprehension in problem-solving questions. Furthermore, the feedback from the questionnaire surveys show students' learning interest can be fostered when an animated agent is integrated into multimedia teaching materials, and that students prefer to adopt the Web-based multimedia learning system for independent learning after school.

AB Metadata registry (MDR) is based on the international standard ISO/IEC 11179. The committee of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32, which had standardized the MDR, has started to improvise the MDR, and the improvised version is named extended MDR (XMDR). However, the XMDR does not fully support the ontology concept, and no method is available for mapping ontology registrations onto registries. To overcome the limitations of the outdated XMDR, this paper proposes an extended XMDR (XMDR+) framework. The XMDR+ framework provides a method for mapping of ontology registrations between the metadata registry and ontologies. To improve the functions of the XMDR, we have proposed herein a framework that is capable of defining a model that manages the relations not only among ontological concepts but also among instances, and guarantees the management and storage of their relationships for supporting valid relations of the ontologies.

TI Energy Efficient Skyline Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE sensor network; skyline query; filtering; priority
AB In sensor networks, many studies have been proposed to process in-network aggregation efficiently. Unlike general aggregation queries, skyline query processing compares multi-dimensional data for the result. Therefore, it is very difficult to process the skyline queries in sensor networks. It is important to filter unnecessary data for energy-efficient skyline query processing. Existing approaches get rid of unnecessary data transmission by deploying filters to whole sensors. However, network lifetime is reduced due to energy consumption for transmitting filters. In this paper, we propose a lazy filtering-based in-network skyline query processing algorithm to reduce energy consumption by transmitting filters. Our algorithm creates the skyline filter table (SET) in the data gathering process which sends data from sensor nodes to the base station and filters out unnecessary data transmissions using it. The experimental results show that our algorithm reduces false positive by 53% and improves network lifetime by 44% on average over the existing method.

DE speech recognition; speaker adaptation; speaker-class model; LVCSR;
   corpus of spontaneous Japanese
AB In this paper, we propose a new speaker-class modeling and its adaptation method for the LVCSR system and evaluate the method on the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ). In this method, closer speakers are selected from training speakers and the acoustic models are trained by using their utterances for each evaluation speaker. One of the major issues of the speaker-class model is determining the selection range of speakers. In order to solve the problem, several models which have a variety of speaker range are prepared for each evaluation speaker in advance, and the most proper model is selected on a likelihood basis in the recognition step. In addition, we improved the recognition performance using unsupervised speaker adaptation with the speaker-class models. In the recognition experiments, a significant improvement could be obtained by using the proposed speaker adaptation based on speaker-class models compared with the conventional adaptation method.

ID POSITION
AB In this work, spatial information consisting of the position and orientation angle of an acoustic source is estimated by an artificial neural network (ANN). The estimated position of a speaker in an enclosed space is used to refine the estimated time delays for a delay-and-sum beamformer, thus enhancing the output signal. On the other hand, the orientation angle is used to restrict the lexicon used in the recognition phase, assuming that the speaker faces a particular direction while speaking. To compensate the effect of the transmission channel inside a short frame analysis window, a new cepstral mean normalization (CMN) method based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is investigated and shows better performance than the conventional CMN for short utterances. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through Japanese digit/command recognition experiments.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Detecting emergency situation is very important to a surveillance system for people like elderly live alone. A vision-based emergency response system with a paramedic mobile robot is presented in this paper. The proposed system is consisted of a vision-based emergency detection system and a mobile robot as a paramedic. A vision-based emergency detection system detects emergency by tracking people and detecting their actions from image sequences acquired by single surveillance camera. In order to recognize human actions, interest regions are segmented from the background using blob extraction method and tracked continuously using generic model. Then a MHI (Motion History Image) for a tracked person is constructed by silhouette information of region blobs and model actions. Emergency situation is finally detected by applying these information to neural network. When an emergency is detected, a mobile robot can help to diagnose the status of the person in the situation. To send the mobile robot to the proper position, we implement mobile robot navigation algorithm based on the distance between the person and a mobile robot. We validate our system by showing emergency detection rate and emergency response demonstration using the mobile robot.

TI A Novel Post-Silicon Debug Mechanism Based on Suspect Window

ID CHIP; SYSTEM
AB Bugs are becoming unavoidable in complex integrated circuit design. It is imperative to identify the bugs as soon as possible through post-silicon debug. For post-silicon debug, observability is one of the biggest challenges. Scan-based debug mechanism provides high observability by reusing scan chains. However, it is not feasible to scan dump cycle-by-cycle during program execution due to the excessive time required. In fact, it is not necessary to scan out the error-free states. In this paper, we introduce Suspect Window to cover the clock cycle in which the bug is triggered. Then, we present an efficient approach to determine the suspect window. Based on Suspect Window, we propose a novel debug mechanism to locate the bug both temporally and spatially. Since scan dumps are only taken in the suspect window with the proposed mechanism, the time required for locating the bug is greatly reduced. The approaches are evaluated using ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can significantly reduce the overall debug time compared to scan-based debug mechanism while keeping high observability.

TI Decidability of Termination and Innermost Termination for Term Rewriting
   Systems with Right-Shallow Dependency Pairs
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE looping sequence; argument propagation
ID PROOFS; RULES
AB In this paper, we show that the termination and the innermost termination properties are decidable for the class of term rewriting systems (TRSs for short) all of whose dependency pairs are right-linear and right-shallow. We also show that the innermost termination is decidable for the class of TRSs all of whose dependency pairs are shallow. The key observation common to these two classes is as follows: for every TRS in the class, we can construct, by using the dependency-pairs information, a finite set of terms such that if the TRS is non-terminating then there is a looping sequence beginning with a term in the finite set. This fact is obtained by modifying the analysis of argument propagation in shallow dependency pairs proposed by Wang and Sakai in 2006. However we gained a great benefit that the resulted procedures do not require any decision procedure of teachability problem used in Wang's procedure for shallow case, because known decidable classes of reachability problem are not larger than classes discussing in this paper.

AB Continuous pen pressure can be used to operate multistate widgets such as menus in pen based user interfaces. The number of levels into which the pen pressure space is divided determines the number of states in the multi-state widgets. To increase the optimal number of divisions of the pen pressure space and achieve greater pen pressure usability, we propose a new discretization method which divides the pen pressure space according to a personal pen pressure use profile. We present here four variations of the method: discretization according to personal/aggregation pen pressure use profile with/without visual feedback of uniform level widths and the traditional even discretization method. Two experiments were conducted respectively to investigate pen pressure use profile and to comparatively evaluate the performance of these methods. Results indicate that the subjects performed fastest and with the fewest errors when the pen pressure space was divided according to personal profile with visual feedback of uniform level widths (PU) and performed worst when the pen pressure space was divided evenly. With PU method, the optimal number of divisions of the pen pressure space was 8. Visual feedback of uniform level widths enhanced performance of uneven discretization. The findings of this study have implications for human-oriented pen pressure use in pen pressure based user interface designs.

AB Finding a kernel mapping function for support vector machines (SVMs) is a key step towards construction of a high-performanced SVM-based classifier While some recent methods exploited an evolutional approach to construct a suitable multifunction kernel, most of them searched randomly and diversely In this paper. the concept of a family of identical-structured kernel trees is proposed to enable exploration of structure space using genetic programming whereas to pursue investigation of parameter space on a certain tree using evolution strategy To control balance between structure and parameter search towards an optimal kernel, simulated aline:ding is introduced By experiments on a number of benchmark datasets in the UCI and text classification collection the proposed method is shown to be able to find a better optimal solution than other search methods, including grid search and gradient search.

AB For fast egomotion of a camera, computing feature correspondence and motion parameters by global search becomes highly time-consuming. Therefore, the complexity of the estimation needs to be reduced for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a compound omnidirectional vision sensor and an algorithm for estimating its fast egomotion. The proposed sensor has both multi-baselines and a large field of view (FOV). Our method uses the multi-baseline stereo vision capability to classify feature points as near or far features. After the classification, we can estimate the camera rotation and translation separately by using random sample consensus (RANSAC) to reduce the computational complexity. The large FOV also improves the robustness since the translation and rotation are clearly distinguished. To date, there has been no work on combining multi-baseline stereo with large FOV characteristics for estimation. even though these characteristics are individually are important in improving egomotion estimation. Experiments showed that the proposed method is robust and produces reasonable accuracy in real time for fast motion of the sensor.

TI Class-Dependent Modeling for Dialog Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE dialog translation; class-dependent; mixture model
AB This paper presents a technique for class-dependent decoding for statistical machine translation (SMT). The approach differs from previous methods of class-dependent translation in that the class-dependent forms of all models are integrated directly into the decoding process. We employ probabilistic mixture weights between models that can change dynamically on a sentence-by-sentence basis depending on the characteristics of the source sentence. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by evaluating its performance on travel conversation data. We used this approach to tackle the translation of questions and declarative sentences using class-dependent models. To achieve this, our system integrated two sets of models specifically built to deal with sentences that fall into one of two classes of dialog sentence: questions and declarations, with a third set of models built with all of the data to handle the general case. The technique was thoroughly evaluated on data from 16 language pairs using 6 machine translation evaluation metrics. We found the results were corpus-dependent, but in most cases our system was able to improve translation performance, and for some languages the improvements were substantial.

AB This paper presents a new multi-layered artificial immune system architecture using the ideas generated from the biological immune system for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology is composed of five layers. After expressing the problem as, a suitable representation in the first layer, the search space and the features of the problem are estimated and extracted in the second and third layers, respectively. Through taking advantage of the minimized search space from estimation and the heuristic information from extraction, the antibodies (or solutions) are evolved in the fourth layer and finally the fittest antibody is exported. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system, the graph planarization problem is tested. Simulation results based on several benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm performs better than traditional algorithms.

   Information as Search Tags
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE P2P file sharing; folksonomy; query forwarding; Kansei; human
AB We present the concept of folksonomical peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks that allow participants (peers) to freely assign structured search tags to files. These networks are similar to folksonomies in the present Web front the point of view that users assign search tags to information distributed over a network. As a concrete example, we consider an unstructured P2P network using vectorized Kansei (human sensitivity) information as structured search tags for file search. Vectorized Kansei information as search tags indicates what participants feel about their files and is assigned by the participant to each of their files. A search query also has the same form of search tags and indicates what participants want to feel about files that they will eventually obtain. A method that enables file search using vectorized Kansei information is the Kansei query-forwarding method, which probabilistically propagates a search query to peers that are likely to hold more files having search tags that are similar to the query. The similarity between the search query and the search tags is measured in terms of their do product. The simulation experiments examine if the Kansei query-forwarding method can provide equal search performance for all peers in a network in which only the Kansei information and the tendency with respect to file collection are different among all of the peers. The simulation results show that the Kansei query forwarding method and a random-walk-based query forwarding method, for comparison, work effectively in different situations and are complementary. Furthermore, the Kansei query forwarding method is shown. through simulations. to be superior to or equal to the random-walk based one in terms of search speed.

TI Dependency Parsing with Lattice Structures for Resource-Poor Languages
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE dependency parser; under-resourced languages; morphosyntactic lattice
   structure; Dependency Insertion Grammar; k-best parsing
AB In this paper, we present a new dependency parsing method for languages which have very small annotated corpus and for which methods of segmentation and morphological analysis producing a unique (automatically disambiguated) result are very unreliable. Our method works on a morphosyntactic lattice factorizing all possible segmentation and part-of-speech tagging results. The quality of the input to syntactic analysis is hence much better than that of an unreliable unique sequence of lemmatized and tagged words. We propose an adaptation of Eisner's algorithm for finding the k-best dependency trees in a morphosyntactic lattice structure encoding multiple results of morphosyntactic analysis. Moreover, we present how to use Dependency Insertion Grammar in order to adjust the scores and filter out invalid trees, the use of language model to rescore the parse trees and the k-best extension of our parsing model. The highest parsing accuracy reported in this paper is 74.32% which represents a 6.31% improvement compared to the model taking the input from the unreliable morphosyntactic analysis tools.

AB In this paper, we propose a new approach to rotation invariant texture analysis. This method uses the Radon transform with some considerations in direction estimation of textural images. Furthermore, it utilizes the information obtained from the number of peaks in the variance array of the Radon transform as a realty feature. The textural features are then generated after rotation of texture along principle direction. Also, to eliminating the introduced error due to rotation of texture, a simple technique is presented. Experimental results on a set of images from the Brodatz album show a good performance achieved by the proposed method in comparison with some recent texture analysis methods.

AB In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm for multi-class classification. The proposed algorithm is based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of the features, and it uses the distance between the two least separable classes as a metric for feature selection. The proposed system was tested with a support vector machine (SVM) for multi-class classification of music. Results show that the proposed feature selection scheme is superior to conventional schemes.

AB Let u and v be any two distinct vertices of an undirected graph G, which is k-connected. For 1 <= w <= k, a w-container C(u, v) of a k-connected graph G is a set of w-disjoint paths joining u and v. A w-container C(u, v) of G is a w*-container if it contains all the vertices of G. A graph G is w*-connected if there exists a w*-container between any two distinct vertices. Let K(G) be the connectivity of G. A graph G is super spanning connected if G is i*-connected for 1 <= i <= K(G). In this paper, we prove that the n-dimensional burnt pancake graph B(n) is super spanning connected if and only if n not equal 2.

AB It is a tedious and subjective task to measure severity of a dysarthria by manually evaluating his/her speech using available standard assessment methods based on human perception. This paper presents an automated approach to assess speech quality of a dysarthric speaker with cerebral palsy. With the consideration of two complementary factors, speech consistency and speech distinction, a speech quality indicator called speech clarity index (Psi) is proposed as a measure of the speaker's ability to produce consistent speech signal for a certain word and distinguished speech signal for different words. As an application, it can be used to assess speech quality and forecast speech recognition rate of speech made by an individual dysarthric speaker before actual exhaustive implementation of an automatic speech recognition system for the speaker. The effectiveness of Psi as a speech recognition rate predictor is evaluated by rank-order inconsistency, correlation coefficient, and root-mean-square of difference. The evaluations had been done by comparing its predicted recognition rates with one predicted by the standard methods called the articulatory and intelligibility tests based on the two recognition systems (HMM and ANN). The results show that Psi is a promising indicator for predicting recognition rate of dysarthric speech. All experiments had been done on speech corpus composed of speech data from eight normal speakers and eight dysarthric speakers.

AB Delivering video streaming service over the Internet encounters some challenges. Two of them are heterogeneity of networks capacity and variability of video data rate. The capacity of network segments are constrained. Meanwhile, the rate of video data to be transmitted is highly variable in order to get near-constant images quality. Therefore, to send variable bit rate (VBR) video data over capacity-constrained network, its bit rate should be adjusted. In this paper a system to adjust the transmission bit rate of VBR MPEG video data called Transcoding-after-Smoothing (TaS), which is a combination of bit rate transcoding and bit rate smoothing algorithm, is proposed. The system smoothes out transmission rate of video data while at the same time also performs transcoding on some video frames when necessary in order to keep the transmission bit rate below a certain threshold value. Two kinds of TaS methods are proposed. One method does not have transcoding preference, while the other method uses frame type preference where an intra-coded frame is the last one that will be transcoded. These methods are implemented in our video server where a VBR video data is accessed by a client. Our experiment results show that the first TaS method yields significant reduction in the number of transcoded frames compared with the second TaS method and conventional frame-level transcoding. However, the second method performs better in minimizing the quality distortion.

AB Conventional interest point based matching requires computationally expensive patch preprocessing and is not appropriate for recognition of plain objects with negligible detail. This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive interest regions from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of plain objects or scene. We formulate the correspondence problem in a Naive Bayesian classification framework and a simple correlation based matching, which makes our system fast, simple, efficient, and robust. To facilitate the matching using a very small number of interest regions, we also propose a method to reduce the search area inside a test scene. Using this method, it is possible to robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance. Our system performs remarkably well on plain objects where some state-of-the art methods fail. Since our system is particularly suitable for the recognition of plain object, we refer to it as Simple Plane Object Recognizer (SPOR).

AB Body movement synchrony (i.e. rhythmic synchronization between the body movements of interacting partners) has been described by subjective impressions of skilled counselors and has been considered to reflect the depth of the client-counselor relationship. This study analyzed temporal changes in body movement synchrony through a video analysis of client-counselor dialogues in counseling sessions. Four 50-minute psychotherapeutic counseling sessions were analyzed, including two negatively evaluated sessions (low evaluation groups) and two positively evaluated sessions (high evaluation groups). In addition, two 50-minute ordinary advice sessions between two high school teachers and the clients in the high rating group were analyzed. All sessions represent role-playing. The intensity of the participants' body movement was measured using a video-based system. Temporal change of body movement synchrony was analyzed using moving correlations of the intensity between the two time series. The results revealed (1) A consistent temporal pattern among the four counseling cases, though the moving correlation coefficients were higher for the high evaluation group than the low evaluation group and (2) Different temporal patterns for the counseling and advice sessions even when the clients were the same. These results were discussed from the perspective of the quality of client-counselor relationship.

ID YOUNG CHILDRENS INDUCTIONS; INFANTS
AB In this study, we conducted a series of experiments using stimuli characterized by various attributes in order to understand the categorization process in an infant's pre-linguistic development. The infants are able to assign the same label to members within the same category by focusing attention on specific features or functions common to the members. The ability to categorize is likely to play an essential role in an infant's overall cognitive development. Specifically, we investigated how the infants use different strategies in the process of linguistic categorization. In one strategy, members of a single category are derived from perceptual similarities within the most representative members, i.e., the prototypical members. Alternatively, each membership is established by referring to the linguistic labels for each category provided by the caretaker, in a symbol grounding process. We found that the infant is able to employ these strategies in a flexible manner in its development. We discuss the interplay between different cognitive strategies, including the prototype effects in the infant's cognitive development and the implications for cortical mechanism involved.

DT Article
DE NGN; security; authentication; standard
AB Next Generation Network (NGN), which has been undergoing standardization as it has developed, is expected to create new services that converge the fixed and mobile networks. This paper introduces the basic requirements for NGN in terms of security and explains the standardization activities, in particular, the requirements for the security function described in Y.2701 discussed in ITU-T SG-13. In addition to the basic NGN security function, requirements for NGN authentication are also described from three aspects: security, deployability, and service. As examples of authentication implementation, three profiles-namely, fixed, nomadic, and mobile-are defined in this paper. That is, the "fixed profile" is typically for fixed-line subscribers, the "nomadic profile" basically utilizes WiFi access points, and the "mobile profile" provides ideal NGN mobility for mobile subscribers. All three of these profiles satisfy the requirements from security aspects. The three profiles are compared from the viewpoint of requirements for deployability and service. After showing that none of the three profiles can fulfill all of the requirements, we propose that multiple profiles should be used by NGN providers. As service and application examples, two promising NGN applications are proposed. The first is a strong authentication mechanism that makes Web applications more safe and secure even against password theft. It is based on NGN ID federation function. The second provides an easy peer-to-peer broadband virtual private network service aimed at safe and secure communication for personal/SOHO (small office, home office) users, based on NGN SIP (session initiation protocol) session control.

TI Query language for location-based services: A model checking approach
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE ubiquitous computing; location-based services; query language; model
   checking
AB We present a model checking approach to the rationale, implementation, and applications of a query language for location-based services. Such query mechanisms are necessary so that users, objects, and/or services can effectively benefit from the location-awareness of their surrounding environment. The underlying data model is founded on a symbolic model of space organized in a tree structure. Once extended to a semantic model for modal logic, we regard location query processing as a model checking problem, and thus define location queries as hybrid logic-based formulas. Our approach is unique to existing research because it explores the connection between location models and query processing in ubiquitous computing systems, relies on a sound theoretical basis, and provides modal logic-based query mechanisms for expressive searches over a decentralized data structure. A prototype implementation is also presented and will be discussed.

DT Article
DE low power test; scan-based test; X-filling; test application time
AB This paper proposes the minimum transition random X-filling (MTR-fill) technique, which is a new X-filling method, to reduce the amount of power dissipation during scan-based testing. In order to model the amount of power dissipated during scan load/unload cycles, the total weighted transition metric (TWTM) is introduced, which is calculated by the sum of the weighted transitions in a scan-load of a test pattern and a scan-unload of a test response. The proposed MTR-fill is implemented by simulated annealing method. During the annealing process, the TWTM of a pair of test patterns and test responses are minimized. Simultaneously, the MTR-fill attempts to increase the randomness of test patterns in order to reduce the number of test patterns needed to achieve adequate fault coverage. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is shown through experiments for ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits.

AB If a test set for more complex faults than stuck-at faults is generated, higher defect coverage would be obtained. Such a test set, however, would have a large number of test vectors, and hence the test costs would go up. In this paper we propose a method to detect bridge defects with a test set initially generated for stuck-at faults in a full scan sequential circuit. The proposed method doesn't add new test vectors to the test set but modifies test vectors. Therefore there are no negative impacts on test data volume and test application time. The initial fault coverage for stuck-at faults of the test set is guaranteed with modified test vectors. In this paper we focus on detecting as many as possible non-feedback AND-type, OR-type and 4-way bridging faults, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases the defect coverage.

TI Linear discriminant analysis using a generalized mean of class

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE speech recognition; feature extraction; multidimensional signal
   processing
AB To precisely model the time dependency of features is one of the important issues for speech recognition. Segmental unit input HMM with a dimensionality reduction method has been widely used to address this issue. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and heteroscedastic extensions, e.g., heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) or heteroscedastic discriminant analysis (HDA), are popular approaches to reduce dimensionality. However, it is difficult to find one particular criterion suitable for any kind of data set in carrying out dimensionality reduction while preserving discriminative information. In this paper, we propose a new framework which we call power linear discriminant analysis (PLDA). PLDA can be used to describe various criteria including LDA, HLDA, and HDA with one control parameter. In addition, we provide an efficient selection method using a control parameter without training HMMs nor testing recognition performance on a development data set. Experimental results show that the PLDA is more effective than conventional methods for various data sets.

AB This letter evaluates the relative contributions of temporal fine structure cues in various frequency bands to Mandarin tone perception using novel "auditory chimaeras". Our results confirm the importance of temporal fine structure cues to lexical tone perception and the dominant region of lexical tone perception is found, namely the second to fifth harmonics can contribute no less than the fundamental frequency itself.

TI Parzen-window based normalized mutual information for medical image

DT Article
DE parzen-window method; normalized mutual information; medical image
   registration; optimization
AB Image Registration can be seen as an optimization problem to find a cost function and then use an optimization method to get its minimum. Normalized mutual information is a widely-used robust method to design a cost function in medical image registration. Its calculation is based on the joint histogram of the fixed and transformed moving images. Usually, only a discrete joint histogram is considered in the calculation of normalized mutual information. The discrete joint histogram does not allow the cost function to be explicitly differentiated, so it can only use non-gradient based optimization methods, such as Powell's method, to seek the minimum. In this paper, a parzen-window based method is proposed to estimate the continuous joint histogram in order to make it possible to derive the close form solution for the derivative of the cost function. With this help, we successfully apply the gradient-based optimization method in registration. We also design a new kernel for the parzen-window based method. Our designed kernel is a second order polynomial kernel with the width of two. Because of good theoretical characteristics, this kernel works better than other kernels, such as a cubic B-spline kernel and a first order B-spline kernel, which are widely used in the parzen-window based estimation. Both rigid and non-rigid registration experiments are done to show improved behavior of our designed kernel. Additionally, the proposed method is successfully applied to a clinical CT-MR non-rigid registration which is able to assist a magnetic resonance (MR) guided microwave thermocoagulation of liver tumors.

DT Article
DE agent-oriented software engineering; multi-agent system analysis and
   design; activity theory; conflict solution; contradiction patterns
AB The specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) involves the identification of a large number of entities and their relationships. This is a non-trivial task that requires managing different views of the system. Many problems concerning this issue originate in the presence of contradictory goals and tasks, inconsistencies, and unexpected behaviours. Such troublesome configurations should be detected and prevented during the development process in order to study alternative ways to cope with them. In this paper, we present methods and tools that support the management of contradictions during the analysis and design of MAS. Contradiction management in MAS has to consider both individual (i.e. agent) and social (i.e. organization) aspects, and their dynamics. Such issues have already been considered in social sciences, and more concretely in the Activity Theory, a social framework for the study of interactions in activity systems. Our approach applies knowledge from Activity Theory in MAS, especially its base of contradiction patterns. That requires a formalization of this social theory in order to be applicable in a software engineering context and its adaptation to agent-oriented methodologies. Then, it will be possible to check the occurrence of contradiction patterns in a MAS specification and provide solutions to those situations. This technique has been validated by implementing an assistant for the INGENIAS Development Kit and has been tested with several case studies. This paper shows part of one of these experiments for a web application.

AB Test compression / decompression using variable-length coding is an efficient method for reducing the test application cost, i.e., test application time and the size of the storage of an LSI tester. However, some coding techniques impose slow test application, and consequently a large test application time is required despite the high compression. In this paper, we clarify the fact that test application time depends on the compression ratio and the length of codewords and then propose a new Huffman-based coding method for achieving small test application time in a given test environment. The proposed coding method adjusts both of the compression ratio and the minimum length of the codewords to the test environment. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve small test application time while keeping high compression ratio.

ID HALF-TONE IMAGES
AB This letter presents an improved visible watermarking scheme for halftone images. It incorporates watermark embedding into ordered dither halftoning by threshold modulation. The input images include a continuous-tone host image (e.g. an 8-bit gray level image) and a binary watermark image, and the output is a halftone image with a visible watermark. Our method is content adaptive because it takes local intensity information of the host image into account. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed technique. It can be used in practical applications for halftone images, such as commercial advertisement, content annotation, copyright announcement, etc.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE user-centric context; personalized user interface; context-awareness;
   virtual reality
AB In this letter, we propose a enhanced framework for a Personalized User Interface (PUI). This framework allows users to access and customize virtual objects in virtual environments in the sense of sharing user centric context with virtual objects. The proposed framework is enhanced by integrating a unified context-aware application for virtual environments (vr-UCAM 1.5) into virtual objects in the PUI framework. It allows a virtual object to receive context from both real and virtual environments, to decide responses based on context and if-then rules, and to communicate with other objects individually. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we applied it to a virtual heritage system. Experimental results show that we enhance the accessibility and the customizability of virtual objects through the PUI. The proposed framework is expected to play an important role in VR applications such as education, entertainment, and storytelling.

TI Two ways of introducing alternation into context-free grammars and
   pushdown automata
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Two ways of introducing alternation for context-free grammars and pushdown automata are compared. One is the usual way which combines '' states '' with alternation [1], [4],[7], and the other is the way used in [6] to define the alternating context-fret: grammar, i.e., alternation is governed by the variables of the grammar. In this paper the latter way is taken over to define a new type of alternating pushdown automaton by combining the '' pushdown symbols '' of the pushdown automaton with alternation. We have derived a characterization of the original alternating context-free grammars in terms of such a new type of alternating pushdown automaton without states. It is also shown that, if (non-alternating) states are introduced as an additional feature for this type of pushdown automaton, then the resulting alternating pushdown automaton has exactly the same expressive power as the original alternating pushdown automaton.

AB Despite the importance of domain-specific resource construction for domain ontology development, few studies have sought to develop a method for automatically identifying domain ontology-relevant web pages. To address this situation, here we propose a web page filtering scheme for domain ontology that identifies domain-relevant web pages from the web based on the context of concepts. Testing of the proposed filtering scheme with a business domain ontology on YahooPicks web pages yielded promising filtering results that were superior to those obtained using the baseline system.

TI Word error rate minimization using an integrated confidence measure

DT Article
DE word error rate minimization; maximum entropy; support vector machines;
   n-best rescoring
AB This paper describes a new criterion for speech recognition using an integrated confidence measure to minimize the word error rate (WER). The conventional criteria for WER minimization obtain the expected WER of a sentence hypothesis merely by comparing it with other hypotheses in an n-best list. The proposed criterion estimates the expected WER by using an integrated confidence measure with word posterior probabilities for a given acoustic input. The integrated confidence measure, which is implemented as a classifier based on maximum entropy (ME) modeling or support vector machines (SVMs), is used to acquire probabilities reflecting whether the word hypotheses are correct. The classifier is comprised of a variety of confidence measures and can deal with a temporal sequence of them to attain a more reliable confidence. Our proposed criterion for minimizing WER achieved a WER of 9.8% and a 3.9% reduction, relative to conventional n-best rescoring methods in transcribing Japanese broadcast news in various environments such as under noisy field and spontaneous speech conditions.

AB The watershed transform has been used as a powerful morphological segmentation tool in a variety of image processing applications. This is because it gives a good segmentation result if a topographical relief and markers are suitably chosen for different type of images. This paper proposes a parallel implementation of the watershed transform on the cellular neural network (CNN) universal machine, called cellular watersheds. Owing to its fine grain architecture, the watershed transform can be parallelized using local information. Our parallel implementation is based on a simulated immersion process. To evaluate our implementation, we have experimented on the CNN universal chip, ACE16k, for synthetic and real images.

First, we state the problem and the associated KCR lower bound. Then, we describe the algorithms of three well-known methods: FNS, HEIV, and renormalization. We also introduce Gauss-Newton iterations as a new method for fundamental matrix computation. For initial values, we test random choice, least squares, and Taubin's method. Experiments using simulated and real images reveal different characteristics of each method. Overall, FNS exhibits the best convergence properties.

AB Let G be any graph with property P (for example, general graph, directed graph, etc.) and S be nonnegative and non-decreasing integer sequence(s). The prescribed degree sequence problem is a problem to determine whether there is a graph G having S as the prescribed sequence(s) of degrees or outdegrees of the vertices. From 1950's, P has attracted wide attentions, and its many extensions have been considered. Let P be the property satisfying the following (1) and (2):
   (1) G is a directed graph with two disjoint vertex sets A and B.
   (2) There are r(11) (r(22), respectively) directed edges between every pair of vertices in A(B), and r(12) directed edges between every pair of vertex in A and vertex in B.
   Then G is called an (r(11), r(12), r(22))-tournament ("tournament", for short). The problem is called the score sequence pair problem of a "tournament" (realizable, for short). S is called a score sequence pair of a "tournament" if the answer of the problem is "yes." In this paper, we propose the characterizations of a score sequence pair of a "tournament" and an algorithm for determining in linear time whether a pair of two integer sequences is realizable or not.

AB In this paper, we propose a flexible gaze detection method using single PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera. In this method, a PTZ camera traces user's face and measures position of their viewing point, so they do not need to fix their head in front of camera. Furthermore, to realize accurate gaze detection, we employ elliptical iris template matching. To reduce calculation amount of iris template matching, we get rough gaze direction by simple method on ahead to decide ellipse shape. In this paper, we also adapt to variation of facial orientations, which will affect to detect viewing position and gaze direction. After several experiments, we examine accuracy of gaze detection and head tracking ability of this system.

AB This paper presents the characteristics and modeling of VoIP traffic for a real network. The new model, based on measured data, shows a significant difference from the previously proposed models in terms of parameters and their effects. It is found that the effects of background noise and ringing tones have essential influences on the model. The observed distributions of talkspurt and silent durations have long-tail characteristics and considerably differ from the existing models. An additional state called "Long burst", which represents the background noise at the talker's place, is added into the continuous-time Markov process model. The other three states, "Talk", "Short silence" and "Long silence", represent the normal behavior of the VoIP user. Models for conversational speech containing the communication during the dialogue are presented. In the case of the VoIP traffic aggregation, the simplified models, which neglect the conversation's interaction, are proposed. Depending on the occurrences of background noise during the speech, the model is classified as "noisy speech" or "noiseless speech". The measured data shows that the background noise typically increases the data rate by 60%. Simulation results of aggregated VoIP traffic indicate the self-similarity, which is analogous to the measured data. Results from the measurements support the-fact that except the ringing duration the conversations from both the directions can be modeled in identical manner.

AB Automated information extraction systems from biomedical text have been reported. Some systems are based on manually developed rules or pattern matching. Manually developed rules are specific for analysis, however, new rules must be developed for each new domain. Although the corpus must be developed by human effort, a machine-learning approach automatically learns the rules from the corpus. In this article, we present a system for automatically extracting protein-protein interaction information from biomedical text with support vector machines (SVMs). We describe the performance of our system and compare its ability to extract protein-protein interaction information with that of other systems.

AB Extracting visual motion is very important for understanding dynamic actions and for extracting dynamic events from video sequences. Recently, it was shown that some invariants on motions can be extracted from sequential images and applied for recognizing motions from images viewed from arbitrary viewpoints. Unfortunately, these space-time invariants were limited for planar motions viewed from affine cameras. In this paper, we propose a method for computing space-time invariants on non-planar motions viewed from two perspective cameras. The extracted invariants are applied for distinguishing 3D motions from video sequences viewed from arbitrary viewpoints.

The proposed scheme is based on the Point-In-Triangle (PIT) test proposed by He et al. The scheme is actually implemented by using Bluetooth devices of Class 2 standard, and the performance of the scheme is evaluated in an actual environment. The result of experiments indicates that the proposed scheme could realize a localization with an error of less than 2 m.

AB This is commonly thought that CASE tools reduce programming efforts and increase development productivity. However, no paper has provide quantitative data supporting the matter. This paper discusses productivity improvement through the use of an integrated CASE tool system named EAGLE (Effective Approach to Achieving High Level Software Productivity), as shown by various data collected in Hitachi from the 1980s to the 2000s. We have evaluated productivity by using three metrics, 1) program generation rate using reusable program skeletons and components, 2) fault density at two test phase, and 3) learning curve for the education of inexperienced programmers. We will show that productivity has been improved by the various facilities of EAGLE.

AB Development of a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based Korean speech synthesis system and its evaluation is described. Statistical HMM models for Korean speech units are trained with the hand-labeled speech database including the contextual information about phoneme, morpheme, word phrase, utterance, and break strength. The developed system produced speech with a fairly good prosody. The synthesized speech is evaluated and compared with that of our corpus-based unit concatenating Korean text-to-speech system. The two systems were trained with the same manually labeled speech database.

DE Bayesian framework; wide phonetic context model; acoustic rescoring
ID CONTINUOUS-SPEECH RECOGNITION
AB Over the last decade, the Bayesian approach has increased in popularity in many application areas. It uses a probabilistic framework which encodes our beliefs or actions in situations of uncertainty. Information from several models can also be combined based on the Bayesian framework to achieve better inference and to better account for modeling uncertainty. The approach we adopted here is to utilize the benefits of the Bayesian framework to improve acoustic model precision in speech recognition systems, which modeling a wider-than-triphone context by approximating it using several less context-dependent models. Such a composition was developed in order to avoid the crucial problem of limited training data and to reduce the model complexity. To enhance the model reliability due to unseen contexts and limited training data, flooring and smoothing techniques are applied. Experimental results show that the proposed Bayesian pentaphone model improves word accuracy in comparison with the standard triphone model.

AB Landscapes have been the main theme in Chinese painting for over one thousand years. Chinese ink painting is a form of nonphotorealistic rendering. Terrain is the major subject in Chinese landscape painting, and surface wrinkles are important in conveying the orientation of Mountains and contributing to the atmosphere. Over the centuries, masters of Chinese landscape painting have developed various kinds of wrinkles. This work develops a set of novel methods for rendering wrinkles in Chinese landscape painting. A three-dimensional terrain is drawn as an outline and wrinkles, using information oil the shape, shade and orientation of the terrain's polygonal surface. The major contribution of this work lies ill the modeling and implementation of six major types of wrinkles on the surface of terrain. using traditional Chinese brush techniques. Users can select a style of wrinkle and input parameters to control the desired effect. The proposed method then completes the painting process automatically.

AB We propose a novel blind watermarking algorithm, called XFuseMark, which can hide a small, visually meaningful, grayscale logo in a host image instead of using it random-noise-like sequence based on the multiresolution fusion principles, and extract a recognizable version of the embedded logo even without reference to the original host data at the receiving end. XFuseMark is not only secure, i.e., only authorized users holding a private key are able to conduct the logo extraction operation, but also robust against noise addition and image compression. Experiments verify the practical performance of XFuseMark.

ID PARTIAL PROJECTION FILTER
AB The partial projection filter (PTPF) for a given observation operator provides an optimal signal restoration in the presence of both the signal space and observation space noises. However, restoration error by the filter still depends on the observation operator which consists of measurement and sampling processes. In this paper, we determine a sampling operator which minimizes the restoration error by the PTPF. We see that under some assumptions about noise statistics, the restoration error by the PTPF is divided into two terms corresponding to the error arising from the signal space noise and that from the observation space noise. It has been found that although the restoration error due to the signal space noise is independent of the sampling operator, the restoration error arising from the observation space noise can arbitrarily be decreased by increasing the number of sample points in the proposed sampling operator. An illustrative example of optimal sampling in the trigonometric polynomial space is also given.

DE run-length code; compression; test data
AB This letter proposes a run-length code based test data compression technique capable of efficient compression. The proposed test compression method is based on a hybrid run-length encoding, which greatly reduces test data storage on the tester. The code words are carefully selected so as to increase the compression ratio for the test data. Also, a heuristic mapping algorithm and a scan latch reordering method for don't care values in the test cubes increase the compression ratio. Results indicate that the proposed code and heuristic mapping schemes are very efficient in reducing test data. Reduced test data results in less test storage and test time.

AB In medical education, many of computerized Problem-Based Learning (PBL) systems are used into their training curricula. But these systems do not truly reflect the situations which practitioners may actually encounter in a real medical environment, and hence their effectiveness as learning tools is somewhat limited. Therefore, the present study analyzes the computerized PBL teaching case, and considers how a clinical teaching case can best be presented to the student. Specifically, this paper attempts to develop a web-based PBL system which emulates the real clinical situation by introducing the concept of a "time sequence" within each teaching case. The proposed system has been installed in the medical center of National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan for testing purposes. The participants in this study were 50 of 5th grade (equivalent to 1 st grade students in a medical school of the American medical education system) students for the evaluation process. Some experiments are conducted to verify the advantages of designing teaching cases with the concept of the "time sequence."

DE caustics; global illumination; real-time rendering; graphics hardware
AB Caustics are patterns of light focused by reflective or refractive objects. Because of their visually fascinating patterns, several methods have been developed to render caustics. We propose a method for the quick rendering of caustics formed by refracted and converged light through transparent objects. First, in the preprocess, we calculate sampling rays incident on each vertex of the object, and trace the rays until they leave the object taking refraction into account. The position and direction of each ray that finally transmits the transparent object are obtained and stored in a lookup table. Next, in the rendering process, when the object is illuminated, the positions and directions of the rays leaving the object are calculated using the lookup table. This makes it possible to render refractive caustics due to transparent objects at interactive frame rates, allowing us to change the light position and direction, and translate and rotate the object.

DT Article
DE mutual anticipated session; time control; precedent time; reversal of
   order
AB Performing a musical session via networks requires realtime interaction. There exists, however, the problem of delay between the network nodes, which causes musical sessions become an impediment. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a new protocol for musical session called Mutual Anticipated Session (M.A.S.), which is a type of ensemble that controls appropriate timing of sounds. In the M.A.S, one player's performance precedes the other players', thus this performance is called a "precedent musical performance," and we call a time lapse between the players' performance as "precedent time." In the current M.A.S, it is assumed that the tempo during the performance is constant. In such a case, however, players' requirements to perform more expressively or more emotionally by varying the tempo are sacrificed. Thus, in this paper, enhancement of function that accommodates changes of the tempo by predicting tendency of it is realized. Finally we evaluate the enhancement both by system performance test and by task performance of subject experiments.

AB We propose a new method both for automatically creating non-uniform, context-dependent HMM topologies, and selecting the number of mixture components based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) approach. Although the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion is generally used to create HMM topologies, it, has an over-fitting problem. Recently, to avoid this problem, the VB approach has been applied to create acoustic models for speech recognition. We introduce the VB approach to the Successive State Splitting (SSS) algorithm, which can create both contextual and temporal variations for HMMs. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can automatically create a more efficient model than the original method. We evaluated a method to increase the number of mixture components by using the VB approach and considering temporal structures. The VB approach obtained almost the same performance as the smaller number of mixture components in comparison with that obtained by using ML-based methods.

DE SSM; IGMPv3; MGDv2; protocol implementation
AB Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) is recognized as the most feasible multicast communication model for a wide use throughout the Internet because it eliminates many complexities associated with traditional many-to-many multicast communication model. Regarding the SSM communication, however, implementations of the Internet Group Multicast Protocol version 3 (IGMPv3) for IPv4 and the Multicast Listener Discovery version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6 are indispensable on every end-host. Accurate implementations of these protocols are necessary studies for the smooth deployment. In this document, we illustrate IGMPv3 and MLDv2 host-side implementations applied to the 4.4BSD kernel. While presenting the concept and the design of these implementations, we verify the behavior and evaluate the response times for (*,G) and (S,G) joins requested on top of both implementations.

AB As audio and video applications have proliferated on the Internet, transcoding proxy caching has been considered as an important technique for improving network performance, especially for mobile networks. Due to several new emerging factors in the transcoding proxy, existing methods for proxy placement for web caching cannot be simply applied to solve the problem of proxy placement for transcoding proxy caching. This paper addresses the problem of proxy placement for coordinated en-route transcoding proxy caching for tree networks. We propose a model for this problem by including the new emerging factors in the transcoding proxy and present optimal solutions for this problem with/without constraints on the number of transcoding proxies using dynamic programming. Finally, we implement our algorithm and evaluate our model on various performance metrics through extensive simulation experiments. The implementation results show that our model outperforms the existing model for transcoding proxy placement for linear topology, as well as the random proxy placement model. The average improvements of our model over the other models are about 7.2 percent and 21.4 percent in terms of all the performance metrics considered.

DE spam; unsupervised learning; document space density; directmapped cache
AB The volume of mass unsolicited electronic mail, often known as spam, has recently increased enormously and has become a serious threat not only to the Internet but also to society. This paper proposes a new spam detection method which uses document space density information. Although the proposed method requires extensive e-mail traffic to acquire the necessary information, it can achieve perfect detection (i.e., both recall and precision is 100%) under practical conditions. A direct-mapped cache method contributes to the handling of over 13,000 e-mail messages per second. Experimental results, which were conducted using over 50 million actual e-mail messages, are also reported in this paper.

   tutoring system
AB Although production systems are widely used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, they are seen to have certain disadvantages in terms of their need for special purpose assistance software to build and execute their knowledge-bases (KB), and in the fact that they will not run on any operating system (platform dependency). Furthermore, for Al applications such as learning assistance systems, there is a strong requirement for a self-adaptive function enabling a flexible change in the service contents provided, according to the user. Against such a background, a Java based production system (JPS) featuring no requirement for special purpose assistance software and no platform dependency, is proposed. Furthermore, a new self-adaptive Java production system (A-JPS) is proposed to realize the "user adaptation" requirement mentioned above. Its key characteristic is the combination of JPS with a Causal-network (CN) for obtaining a "user profile". In addition, the execution time of the JPS was studied using several benchmark problems with the aim of comparing the effectiveness of different matching algorithms in their recognize-act cycles as well as comparing their performance to that of traditional procedural programs for different problem types. Moreover, the effectiveness of the user adaptation function of the A-JPS was studied for the case of a CN with a general DAG structure, using the experimental KB of a learning assistance system.

AB This paper presents a novel design of connected digit patterns to achieve high accuracy text-prompted speaker verification over a cellular phone network. To reduce the error rate. a phoneme-balanced connected digit pattern for enrollment, and digit-sequence-preserving connected digit patterns for verification (i.e. patterns preserving partial digit sequences of the enrollment pattern) are proposed. In addition to these, a decision procedure using multiple patterns has been designed to overcome the low quality of cellular phone speech. Experimental results on cellular phone speech showed the phoneme-balanced patterns for enrollment and digit-sequence-preserving patterns for verification reduced more than 50% of equal error rate compared to the conventional method using randomly selected and randomly-reordered digit patterns. The decision procedure reduced 60% of the error rate. In addition, this paper shows that verification patterns depending on the pattern of a preceding utterance reduced 10% of the error rate. Overall, the error rate obtained by the proposed method was 1 % for 99% of clients and 95% of impostors.

We show that, for any language L accepted by a linear-time IA, there is an IA which, given an infinite string a(1)a(2)(...) a(i)(...), generates the values of X-L(a(1)),X-L(a(1)a(2)),(...),X-L(a(1)a(2)(...)a(i)),(...) at steps 4,16,..-,4i(2),... respectively. Here, X-L : Sigma* --> {0, 1} is the characteristic function of the language L subset of or equal to E*, defined as X-L(w) = 1 iff w is an element of L. We also construct 2i(3)-time and i(4)-time prefix algorithms for languages accepted by quadratic-time and cubic-time IAs, respectively.

AB Although many researchers have verified the superiority of Support Vector Machine (SVM) on text categorization tasks, some recent papers have reported much lower performance of SVM based text categorization methods when focusing on all types of parts of speech (POS) as input words and treating large numbers of training documents. This was caused by the overfitting problem that SVM sometimes selected unsuitable support vectors for each category in the training set. To avoid the overfitting problem, we propose a two step text categorization method with a variable cascaded feature selection (VCFS) using SVM. VCFS method selects a pair of the best number of words and the best POS combination for each category at each step of the cascade. We made use of the difference of words with the highest mutual information for each category on each POS combination. Through the experiments, we confirmed the validation of VCFS method compared with other SVM based text categorization methods, since our results showed that the macro-averaged F-1 measure (64.8%) of VCFS method was significantly better than any reported F-1 measures, though the micro-averaged F-1 measure (85.4%) of VCFS method was similar to them.

AB Data compression is popularly applied to computer systems and communication systems. Especially, lossless compression is applied to text compression. Since compressed data are very sensitive to errors, several error control methods for data compression using probability model, such as for arithmetic coding, have been proposed. This paper proposes to apply an unequal error protection, or a UEP, scheme to LZ77 coding and LZW coding. This investigates a structure of the compressed data and clarifies a part which is more sensitive to errors than the other by using theoretical analysis and computer simulation. The UEP scheme protects the error-sensitive part from errors more strongly than the others. Computer simulation says that the proposed scheme can recover from errors in the compressed data more effectively than the conventional methods.

DT Article

ID ALGORITHM; MULTIWAY
AB Constraints have been used extensively for the construction of graphical user interfaces. User interface constraints that are declarative are more favorable but require sophisticated constraint planning algorithms. Constraint planning algorithms proposed previously are getting more and more complicated as they were asked to handle more general requirements. We believe that the difficulty is mainly caused by the complicated data structure that is translated directly from the problem. By a transformation, we propose a simplified graph model for the problem and prove that the constraint planning problem can be reduced to finding feedback vertex sets on the simplified graph model. We also consider the general problem of handling nonuniform user interface constraints.

AB A two stage non-scan design for testability method is proposed. The first stage selects test points based on an earlier testability measure conflict. A new design for testability algorithm is proposed to select test points by a fault-oriented testability measure conflict+ in the second stage. Test points are selected in the second stage based on the hard faults after the initial ATPG run of the design for testability circuit in the preliminary stage. The new testability measure conflict+ based on conflict analysis of hard-faults in the process of test generation is introduced, which emulates most general features of sequential ATPG. The new testability measure reduces testability of a fault to the minimum D or D controllability of the primary outputs, and therefore, does not need observability measure any more. Effective approximate schemes are adopted to get reasonable estimation of the testability measure. A couple of effective techniques are also adopted to accelerate the process of the proposed design for testability algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method gets even better results than two of the recent non-scan design for testability methods nscan and lcdft.

AB In this paper, a high-performance pipelining architecture for 2-D inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) is proposed. We use a tree-block pipeline-scheduling scheme to increase computation performance and reduce temporary buffers. The scheme divides the input subbands into several wavelet blocks and processes these blocks one by one, so the size of buffers for storing temporal subbands is greatly reduced. After scheduling the data flow, we fold the computations of all wavelet blocks into the same low-pass and high-pass filters to achieve higher hardware utilization and minimize hardware cost, and pipeline these two filters efficiently to reach higher throughput rate. For the computations of N x N-sample 2-D IDWT with filter length of size K, our architecture takes at most (2/3)N-2 cycles and requires 2N(K-2) registers. In addition, each filter is designed regularly and modularly, so it is easily scalable for different filter lengths and different levels. Because of its small storage, regularity, and high performance, the architecture can be applied to time-critical image decompression.

AB Although there has been a great deal of research on automatic summarization, most methods rely on statistical methods, disregarding relationships between extracted textual segments. We propose a novel method to extract a set of comprehensible sentences which centers on several key points to ensure sentence connectivity. It features a similarity network from documents with a lexical dictionary, and spreading activation to rank sentences. We show evaluation results of a multi-document summarization system based on the method participating in a competition of summarization, TSC (Text Summarization Challenge) task, organized by the third NTCIR project.

AB Most heuristics for the task scheduling problem employ a simple model of the target system, assuming fully connected processors, a dedicated communication subsystem and no contention for communication resources. A small number of algorithms is aware of the contention, using an undirected graph model of the communication network. Although, many scheduling algorithms have been compared in the literature, little is known about the accuracy and appropriateness of the employed models. This article evaluates the accuracy of task scheduling algorithms on generic parallel systems. The performed experiments show a significant inaccuracy of the schedules produced. In an extensive analysis, the reasons for these results are identified and the implications for the scheduling model are discussed.

AB A minimum feedback node set in a graph is a minimum node subset whose deletion makes the graph acyclic. Its detection in a dependency graph is important to recover from a deadlock configuration. A livelock configuration is also avoidable if a check point is set in each node in the minimum feedback node set. Hence, its detection is very important to establish dependable network systems. In this letter, we give a minimum feedback node set in a trivalent Cayley graph. Assuming that each word has n bits, for any node, we can judge if it is included in the set or not in constant time.

AB We present a method for recognition of two-hand gestures. Two-hand gestures include fine-grain descriptions of hands under a complicated background, and have complex dynamic behaviors. Hence, assuming that two-hand gestures are an interacting process of two hands whose shapes and motions are described by switching linear dynamics, we propose a coupled switching linear dynamic model to capture interactions between both hands. The parameters of the model are learned via EM algorithm using approximate computations. Recognition is performed by selection of the model with maximum likelihood out of a few learned models during tracking. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model in tracking and recognition of two-hand gestures through some experiments.

DT Article

ID MOSAICS
AB This paper presents an edge alignment method for stitching images when they have large displacements and light changes. First, without building any correspondences, the proposed method predicts all possible translation solutions by examining the consistency between edge positions. Then, the best solution can be obtained from the set of possible translations by a verification process. The proposed method has better capabilities to stitch images when they have large light changes and displacements. Since the method doesn't require building any correspondences or involve any optimization process, it performs more efficiently than other correlation techniques like feature-matching or phase-correlation approaches. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, different images can be very quickly aligned (less than 0.1 seconds) with the proposed method. Experimental results are provided to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

AB In the study, we build a system called Adaptive Visual Attentive Tracker (AVAT) for the purpose of developing a non-verbal communication channel between the system and an operator who presents intended movements. In the system, we constructed an HMM (Hidden Markov Models)-based TD (Temporal Difference) learning algorithm to track and zoom in on an operator's behavioral sequence which represents his/her intention. AVAT extracts human intended movements from ordinary walking behavior based on the following two algorithms: the first is to model the movements of human body parts using HMMs algorithm, and the second is to learn the model of the tracker's action rising a model-based TD learning algorithm. In the paper, we describe the integrated algorithm of the above two methods: whose linkage is established by assigning the state transition probability in HMM as a reward in TD learning. Experimental results of extracting an operator's hand sign action sequence during her natural walking motion are shown which demonstrates the function of AVAT as it is developed within the framework of perceptual organization. Identification of the sign gesture context through wavelet analysis autonomously provides a reward value for optimizing AVAT's action patterns.

AB This paper presents a new hierarchical scheduling method for a large-scale manufacturing system based on the hybrid Petri-net model, which consists of CPN (Continuous Petri Net) and TPN (Timed Petri Net). The study focuses on an automobile production system, a typical large-scale manufacturing system. At a high level, CPN is used to represent continuous flow in the production process of an entire system, and LP (Linear Programming) is applied to find the optimal flow. At a low level, TPN is used to represent the manufacturing environment of each sub-production line in a decentralized manner, and the MCT algorithm is applied to find feasible semi-optimal process sequences for each sub-production line. Our proposed scheduling method can schedule macroscopically the flow of an entire system while considering microscopically any physical constraints that arise on an actual shop floor.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of multicasting a message in k-ary n-cubes under the store-and-forward model. The objective of the problem is to minimize the size of the resultant multicast tree by keeping the distance to each destination over the tree the same as the distance in the original graph. In the following, we first propose an algorithm that grows a multicast tree in a greedy manner, in the sense that for each intermediate vertex of the tree, the outgoing edges of the vertex are selected in a non-increasing order of the number of destinations that can use the edge in a shortest path to the destination. We then evaluate the goodness of the algorithm in terms of the worst case ratio of the size of the generated tree to the size of an optimal tree. It is proved that for any k greater than or equal to 5 and n greater than or equal to 6, the performnance ratio of the greedy algorithm is c x kn - o(n) for some constant 1/12 less than or equal to c less than or equal to 1/2.

TI Stereo matching between three images by iterative refinement in PVS

AB In the field of computer vision and computer graphics, Image-Based-Rendering (IBR) methods are often used to synthesize images from real scene. The image synthesis by 11311 requires dense correct matching points in the images. However, 11311 does not require 3D geometry reconstruction or camera calibration in Euclidean geometry. On the other hand, 3D reconstructed model can easily point out the occlusion in images. In this paper, we propose an approach to reconstruct 3D shape in a voxel space, which is named Projective Voxel Space (PVS). Since PVS is defined by projective geometry, it requires only weak calibration. PVS is determined by rectifications of the epipolar lines in three images. Three rectified images are orthogonal projected images of a scene in PVS, so processing about image projection is easy in PVS. In both PVS and Euclidean geometry, a point in an image is on a projection from a point on a surface of the object in the scene. Then the other image might have a correct matching point without occlusion, or no matching point because of occlusion. This is a kind of restriction about searching matching points or surface of the object. Taking advantage of simplicity of projection in PVS, the correlation values of points in images are computed, and the values are iteratively refined using the restriction described above. Finally, the shapes of the objects in the scene are acquired in PVS. The reconstructed shape in PVS does not have similarity to 3D shape in Euclidean geometry. However, it denotes consistent matching points in three images, and also indicates the existence of occluded points. Therefore, the reconstructed shape in PVS is sufficient for image synthesis by IBR.

AB The aim of a computer-aided drawing therapy system in this work is to associate drawings which a client makes with the client's mental state in quantitative terms. A case study is conducted on experimental data which contain both pastel drawings and mental state scores obtained from the same client in a psychotherapy program. To perform such association through colors, we translate a drawing to a color feature by measuring its representative colors as primary color rates. A primary color rate of a color is defined from a psychological primary color in a way such that it shows a rate of emotional properties of the psychological primary color which is supposed to affect the color. To obtain several informative colors as representative ones of a drawing, we define two kinds of color: approximate colors extracted by color reduction, and area-averaged colors calculated from the approximate colors. A color analysis method for extracting representative colors from each drawing in a drawing sequence under the same conditions is presented. To estimate how closely a color feature is associated with a concurrent mental state, we propose a method of utilizing machine-learning classification. A practical way of building a classification model through training and validation on a very small dataset is presented. The classification accuracy reached by the model is consid-ered as the degree of association of the color feature with the mental state scores given in the dataset. Experiments were carried out on given clinical data. Several kinds of color feature were compared in terms of the associ-ation with the same mental state. As a result, we found out a good color feature with the highest degree of association. Also, primary color rates proved more effective in representing colors in psychological terms than RGB components. The experimentals provide evidence that colors can be associated with states of human mind.

DE secure function evaluation; garbled circuit; FPGA
AB As more and more programs handle personal information, the demand for secure handling of data is increasing. The protocol that satisfies this demand is called Secure function evaluation (SFE) and has at-tracted much attention from a privacy protection perspective. In two-party SFE, two mutually untrustworthy parties compute an arbitrary function on their respective secret inputs without disclosing any information other than the output of the function. For example, it is possible to execute a program while protecting private information, such as genomic information. The garbled circuit (GC)-a method of program obfuscation in which the pro-gram is divided into gates and the output is calculated using a symmetric key cipher for each gate-is an efficient method for this purpose. However, GC is computationally expensive and has a significant overhead even with an accelerator. We focus on hardware acceleration because of the nature of GC, which is limited to certain types of calculations, such as encryp-tion and XOR. In this paper, we propose an architecture that accelerates garbling by running multiple garbling engines simultaneously based on the latest FPGA-based GC accelerator. In this architecture, managers are in-troduced to perform multiple rows of pipeline processing simultaneously. We also propose an optimized implementation of RAM for this FPGA ac-celerator. As a result, it achieves an average performance improvement of 26% in garbling the same set of programs, compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) garbling accelerator.

   Motion Prediction
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE motion sequences; few-frame prediction; GPLVM; regressive kernel
AB Human motion prediction has always been an interesting research topic in computer vision and robotics. It means forecasting hu-man movements in the future conditioning on historical 3-dimensional hu-man skeleton sequences. Existing predicting algorithms usually rely on extensive annotated or non-annotated motion capture data and are non -adaptive. This paper addresses the problem of few-frame human motion prediction, in the spirit of the recent progress on manifold learning. More precisely, our approach is based on the insight that achieving an accurate prediction relies on a sufficiently linear expression in the latent space from a few training data in observation space. To accomplish this, we propose Regressive Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (RGPLVM) that intro-duces a novel regressive kernel function for the model training. By doing so, our model produces a linear mapping from the training data space to the latent space, while effectively transforming the prediction of human motion in physical space to the linear regression analysis in the latent space equiva-lent. The comparison with two learning motion prediction approaches (the state-of-the-art meta learning and the classical LSTM-3LR) demonstrate that our GPLVM significantly improves the prediction performance on var-ious of actions in the small-sample size regime.

AB Involving higher-order thinking in learning activities can produce meaningful learning. It impacts the student's ability to solve prob-lems in new situations. Concept mapping is a learning strategy that has been proven to promote higher-order thinking. Concept map recomposition (KB-mapping) in the Kit-Build system is a closed concept mapping where learners are given concepts and links to build a concept map, and it has advantage that the recomposed map can be automatically diagnosed. It has been proven that KB-mapping improves the students' learning achievement similar to the traditional concept mapping called scratch concept map com-position (SC-mapping). However, the study on the effect of KB-mapping in fostering students' higher-order thinking has yet to be evaluated. This study designed and conducted an experiment to compare the impact of KB-mapping and SC-mapping on promoting students' ability in higher-order thinking. Fifty-four undergraduate students were assigned to either KB-Mapping or SC-Mapping for learning activities. The result of this study suggested that students who learn with KB-mapping had better abilities to solve questions of higher-order thinking than those who applied SC-mapping. The findings also suggested that the quality of students' concept maps affected their performance in solving higher-order thinking questions.

AB Let us consider a regular expression r of length m and a text string T of length n over an alphabet sigma. Then, the RE minimal substring search problem is to find all minimal substrings of T matching r. Yamamoto proposed O(mn) time and O(m) space algorithm using a Thompson automaton. In this paper, we improve Yamamoto's algorithm by introducing parallelism. The proposed algorithm runs in O(mn) time in the worst case and in O(mn/p) time in the best case, where p denotes the number of processors. Besides, we show a parameter related to the parallel time of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the algorithm experimentally.

   the Relation between Twitter and Mass Media
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Internet media; social media; Twitter; conversational mass media;
   codependency
AB As the Internet has become prevalent, the popularity of net media has been growing, to a point that it has taken over conventional mass media. However, TWtrends, the Twitter trends visualization system operated by our research team since 2019, indicates that many topics on TV programs frequently appear on Twitter trendlines. This study inves-tigates the relationship between Twitter and TV programs by collecting information on Twitter trends and TV programs simultaneously. Although this study provides a rough estimation of the volume of tweets that mention TV programs, the results show that several tweets mention TV programs at a constant rate, which tends to increase on the weekend. This tendency of TV-related tweets stems from the audience rating survey results. Con-sidering the study outcome, and the fact that many TV programs introduce topics popular in social media, implies codependency between Internet me-dia (social media) and mass media.

AB Stereo depth estimation has become an attractive topic in the computer vision field. Although various algorithms strive to optimize the speed and the precision of estimation, the energy cost of a system is also an essential metric for an embedded system. Among these various algorithms, Semi-Global Matching (SGM) has been a popular choice for some real-world applications because of its accuracy-and-speed balance. However, its power consumption makes it difficult to be applied to an embedded system. Thus, we propose a robust stereo matching system, RT-libSGM, working on the Xilinx Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. The dedicated design of each module optimizes the speed of the entire system while ensuring the flexibility of the system structure. Through an evaluation on a Zynq FPGA board called M-KUBOS, RT-libSGM achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower power consumption. Compared with the benchmark design (libSGM) working on the Tegra X2 GPU, RT-libSGM runs more than 2x faster at a much lower energy cost.

TI Accelerating LiNGAM Causal Discovery with Massive Parallel Execution on

AB Statical causal discovery is an approach to infer the causal relationship between observed variables whose causalities are not revealed. LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model), an algorithm for causal discovery, can calculate the causal relationship uniquely if the independent components of variables are assumed to be non-Gaussian. However, use -cases of LiNGAM are limited because of its O(d3x) computational complex-ity, where dx is the number of variables. This paper shows two approaches to accelerate LiNGAM causal discovery: SIMD utilization for LiNGAM's mathematical matrixes operations and MPI parallelization. We evaluate the implementation with the supercomputer Fugaku. Using 96 nodes of Fu-gaku, our improved version can achieve 17,531 times faster than the origi-nal OSS implementation (completed in 17.7 hours).

TI Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Stance Prediction
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE stance prediction; heterogeneous information network; contrastive
   learning; matrix factorization
AB Stance prediction on social media aims to infer the stances of users towards a specific topic or event, which are not expressed explicitly. It is of great significance for public opinion analysis to extract and determine users' stances using user-generated content on social media. Existing research makes use of various signals, ranging from text content to online network connections of users on these platforms. However, it lacks joint modeling of the heterogeneous information for stance prediction. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework for stance prediction in online debate forums. Firstly, we perform data augmentation on the original heterogeneous information network to generate an augmented view. The original view and augmented view are learned from a meta-path based graph encoder respectively. Then, the contrastive learning among the two views is conducted to obtain high-quality representations of users and issues. Finally, the stance prediction is accomplished by matrix factorization between users and issues. The experimental results on an online debate forum dataset show that our model outperforms other competitive baseline methods significantly.

AB Fault localization analyzes the runtime information of two classes of test cases (i.e., passing test cases and failing test cases) to identify suspicious statements potentially responsible for a failure. However, the failing test cases are always far fewer than passing test cases in reality, and the class imbalance problem will affect fault localization effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a data augmentation approach using conditional variational auto-encoder to synthesize new failing test cases for FL. The experimental results show that our approach significantly improves six state-of-the-art fault localization techniques.

TI Does Student-Submission Allocation Affect Peer Assessment Accuracy?

DE peer assessment; statistical models; MOOCs
AB Peer assessment in education has pedagogical benefits and is a promising method for grading a large number of submissions. At the same time, student reliability has been regarded as a problem; consequently, various methods of estimating highly reliable grades from scores given by multiple students have been proposed. Under most of the existing methods, a nonadaptive allocation pattern, which performs allocation in advance, is assumed. In this study, we analyze the effect of student-submission allocation on score estimation in peer assessment under a nonadaptive allocation setting. We examine three types of nonadaptive allocation methods, random allocation, circular allocation and group allocation, which are considered the commonly used approaches among the existing nonadaptive peer assessment methods. Through simulation experiments, we show that circular allocation and group allocation tend to yield lower accuracy than random allocation. Then, we utilize this result to improve the existing adaptive allocation method, which performs allocation and assessment in parallel and tends to make similar allocation result to circular allocation. We propose the method to replace part of the allocation with random allocation, and show that the method is effective through experiments.

TI Competent Triple Identification for Knowledge Graph Completion under the
   Open-World Assumption
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English

DE knowledge extraction; information retrieval; competent triple; knowledge
   graph completion
AB The usefulness and usability of existing knowledge graphs (KGs) are mostly limited because of the incompleteness of knowledge compared to the growing number of facts about the real world. Most existing ontology-based KG completion methods are based on the closed-world assumption, where KGs are fixed. In these methods, entities and relations are defined, and new entity information cannot be easily added. In contrast, in open-world assumptions, entities and relations are not previously defined. Thus there is a vast scope to find new entity information. Despite this, knowledge acquisition under the open-world assumption is challenging because most available knowledge is in a noisy unstructured text format. Nevertheless, Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems can extract triples, namely (head text; relation text; tail text), from raw text without any prespecified vocabulary. Such triples contain noisy information that is not essential for KGs. Therefore, to use such triples for the KG completion task, it is necessary to identify competent triples for KGs from the extracted triple set. Here, competent triples are the triples that can contribute to add new information to the existing KGs. In this paper, we propose the Competent Triple Identification (CTID) model for KGs. We also propose two types of feature, namely syntax- and semantic-based features, to identify competent triples from a triple set extracted by a state-of-the-art OpenIE system. We investigate both types of feature and test their effectiveness. It is found that the performance of the proposed features is about 20% better compared to that of the REVERB system in identifying competent triples.

TI Weight Sparseness for a Feature-Map-Split-CNN Toward Low-Cost Embedded
   FPGAs
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE CNN; sparse CNN; embedded system; FPGA
AB Convolutional neural network (CNN) has a high recognition rate in image recognition and are used in embedded systems such as smartphones, robots and self-driving cars. Low-end FPGAs are candidates for embedded image recognition platforms because they achieve real-time performance at a low cost. However, CNN has significant parameters called weights and internal data called feature maps, which pose a challenge for FPGAs for performance and memory capacity. To solve these problems, we exploit a split-CNN and weight sparseness. The split-CNN reduces the memory footprint by splitting the feature map into smaller patches and allows the feature map to be stored in the FPGA's high-throughput on-chip memory. Weight sparseness reduces computational costs and achieves even higher performance. We designed a dedicated architecture of a sparse CNN and a memory buffering scheduling for a split-CNN and implemented this on the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board with a low-end FPGA. An experiment on classification using VGG16 shows that our implementation is 3.1 times faster than the GPU, and 5.4 times faster than an existing FPGA implementation.

AB The multi-category support vector machine (MC-SVM) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. There are numerous MC-SVM variants, although different optimization algorithms were developed for diverse learning machines. In this study, we developed a new optimization algorithm that can be applied to several MC-SVM variants. The algorithm is based on the Frank-Wolfe framework that requires two subproblems, direction-finding and line search, in each iteration. The contribution of this study is the discovery that both subproblems have a closed form solution if the Frank-Wolfe framework is applied to the dual problem. Additionally, the closed form solutions on both the direction-finding and line search exist even for the Moreau envelopes of the loss functions. We used several large datasets to demonstrate that the proposed optimization algorithm rapidly converges and thereby improves the pattern recognition performance.

AB Human gait analysis has been widely used in medical and health fields. It is essential to extract spatio-temporal gait features (e.g., single support duration, step length, and toe angle) by partitioning the gait phase and estimating the footprint position/orientation in such fields. Therefore, we propose a method to partition the gait phase given a foot position sequence using mutually constrained piecewise linear approximation with dynamic programming, which not only represents normal gait well but also pathological gait without training data. We also propose a method to detect footprints by accumulating toe edges on the floor plane during stance phases, which enables us to detect footprints more clearly than a conventional method. Finally, we extract four spatial/temporal gait parameters for accuracy evaluation: single support duration, double support duration, toe angle, and step length. We conducted experiments to validate the proposed method using two types of gait patterns, that is, healthy and mimicked hemiplegic gait, from 10 subjects. We confirmed that the proposed method could estimate the spatial/temporal gait parameters more accurately than a conventional skeleton-based method regardless of the gait pattern.

TI A Two-Stage Attention Based Modality Fusion Framework for Multi-Modal
   Speech Emotion Recognition
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE speech emotion recognition; multi-modal fusion; attention mechanism;

AB Recently, automated recognition and analysis of human emotion has attracted increasing attention from multidisciplinary communities. However, it is challenging to utilize the emotional information simultaneously from multiple modalities. Previous studies have explored different fusion methods, but they mainly focused on either inter-modality interaction or intra-modality interaction. In this letter, we propose a novel two-stage fusion strategy named modality attention flow (MAF) to model the intra- and inter-modality interactions simultaneously in a unified end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the widely used late fusion methods, and achieves even better performance when the number of stacked MAF blocks increases.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Resource sharing is to ensure required resources available for their demanders. However, due to the lack of proper sharing model, the current sharing rate of the scientific and technological resources is low, impeding technological innovation and value chain development. Here we propose a novel method to share scientific and technological resources by storing resources as nodes and correlations as links to form a complex network. We present a few-shot relational learning model to solve the cold-start and long-tail problems that are induced by newly added resources. Experimentally, using NELL-One and Wiki-One datasets, our one-shot results outperform the baseline framework - metaR by 40.2% and 4.1% on MRR in Pre-Train setting. We also show two practical applications, a resource graph and a resource map, to demonstrate how the complex network helps resource sharing.

AB A classification function maps a set of vectors into several classes. A machine learning problem is treated as a design problem for partially defined classification functions. To realize classification functions forMNIST hand written digits, three different architectures are considered: Single-unit realization, 45-unit realization, and 45-unit xr realization. The 45-unit realization consists of 45 ternary classifiers, 10 counters, and a max selector. Test accuracy of these architectures are compared using MNIST data set.

TI Neural Architecture Search for Convolutional Neural Networks with
   Attention
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE neural architecture search; object recognition; attention mechanism
AB The recent development of neural architecture search (NAS) has enabled us to automatically discover architectures of neural networks with high performance within a few days. Convolutional neural networks extract fruitful features by repeatedly applying standard operations (convolutions and poolings). However, these operations also extract useless or even disturbing features. Attention mechanisms enable neural networks to discard information of no interest, having achieved the state-of-the-art performance. While a variety of attentions for CNNs have been proposed, current NAS methods have paid a little attention to them. In this study, we propose a novel NAS method that searches attentions as well as operations. We examined several patterns to arrange attentions and operations, and found that attentions work better when they have their own search space and follow operations. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method in experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. The found architecture achieved lower classification error rates and required fewer parameters compared to those found by current NAS methods.

AB During the execution of software systems, their execution data can be recorded. By fully exploiting these data, software practitioners can discover behavioral models describing the actual execution of the underlying software system. The recorded unstructured software execution data may be too complex, spanning over several days, etc. Applying existing discovery techniques results in spaghetti-like models with no clear structure and no valuable information for comprehension. Starting from the observation that a software system is composed of a set of logical components, Liu et al. propose to decompose the software behavior discovery problem into smaller independent ones by discovering a behavioral model per component in [1]. However, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is not fully evaluated and compared with existing approaches. In this paper, we evaluate the quality (in terms of understandability/complexity) of discovered component behavior models in a quantitative manner. Based on evaluation, we show that this approach can reduce the complexity of the discovered model and gives a better understanding.

AB Software maintenance is an important activity in the software lifecycle. Software maintenance does not only mean removing faults found after software release. Software needs extensions or modifications of its functions owing to changes in the business environment and software maintenance also refers to them. To help users and service suppliers benchmark work efficiency for software maintenance, and to clarify the relationships between software quality, work efficiency, and unit cost of staff, we used a dataset that includes 134 data points collected by the Economic Research Association in 2012, and analyzed the factors that affected the work efficiency of software maintenance. In the analysis, using a multiple regression model, we clarified the relationships between work efficiency and programming language and productivity factors. To analyze the influence to the quality, relationships of fault ratio was analyzed using correlation coefficients. The programming language and productivity factors affect work efficiency. Higher work efficiency and higher unit cost of staff do not affect the quality of software maintenance.

DE sketch face recognition; triplet loss; center loss; hard triplet sample
   selection
AB Sketch face recognition is to match sketch face images to photo face images. The main challenge of sketch face recognition is learning discriminative feature representations to ensure intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. However, traditional sketch face recognition methods encouraged samples with the same identity to get closer, and samples with different identities to be further, and these methods did not consider the intra-class compactness of samples. In this paper, we propose triplet-margin-center loss to cope with the above problem by combining the triplet loss and center loss. The triplet-margin-center loss can enlarge the distance of inter-class samples and reduce intra-class sample variations simultaneously, and improve intra-class compactness. Moreover, the triplet-margin-center loss applies a hard triplet sample selection strategy. It aims to effectively select hard samples to avoid unstable training phase and slow converges. With our approach, the samples from photos and from sketches taken from the same identity are closer, and samples from photos and sketches come from different identities are further in the projected space. In extensive experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves marked improvements in most cases.

ID DISPLAY
AB In this paper, we propose an accurate calibration method for glassless stereoscopic systems. The method uses a lenticular lens on a general display. Glassless stereoscopic displays are currently used in many fields; however, accurately adjusting their physical display position is difficult because an accuracy of several microns or one hundredth of a degree is required, particularly given their larger display area. The proposed method enables a dynamic adjustment of the positions of images on the display to match various physical conditions in three-dimensional (3D) displays. In particular, compared with existing approaches, this avoids degradation of the image quality due to the image location on the screen while improving the image quality by local mapping. Moreover, it is shown to decrease the calibration time by performing simultaneous processing for each local area. As a result of the calibration, the offset jitter representing the crosstalk reduces from 14.946 to 8.645 mm. It is shown that high-quality 3D videos can be generated. Finally, we construct a stereoscopic viewing system using a high-resolution display and lenticular lens and produce high-quality 3D images with automatic calibration.

AB This paper proposes a method for heatmapping people who are involved in a group activity. Such people grouping is useful for understanding group activities. In prior work, people grouping is performed based on simple inflexible rules and schemes (e.g., based on proximity among people and with models representing only a constant number of people). In addition, several previous grouping methods require the results of action recognition for individual people, which may include erroneous results. On the other hand, our proposed heatmapping method can group any number of people who dynamically change their deployment. Our method can work independently of individual action recognition. A deep network for our proposed method consists of two input streams (i.e., RGB and human bounding-box images). This network outputs a heatmap representing pixelwise confidence values of the people grouping. Extensive exploration of appropriate parameters was conducted in order to optimize the input bounding-box images. As a result, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for heatmapping people involved in group activities.

ID SPEECH; FORMANT
AB Lombard speech is produced in noisy environments due to the Lombard effect and is intelligible in adverse environments. To adaptively control the intelligibility of transmitted speech for public announcement systems, in this study, we focus on perceptually mimicking Lombard speech under backgrounds with varying noise levels. Other approaches map corresponding neutral speech features to Lombard speech features, but as this can only be applied to one noise level at a time, it is unsuitable for varying noise levels because the characteristics of Lombard speech are varied according to noise level. Instead, we utilize a rule-based method that automatically generates rules and flexibly controls features with any change of noise level. Specifically, we conduct a feature tendency analysis and propose a continuous rule generation model to estimate the effect of varying noise levels on features. The proposed techniques, which are based on a coarticulation model, MRTD, and spectral-GMM, can easily modify neutral speech features by following the generated rules. Voices having these features are then synthesized by STRAIGHT to obtain Lombard speech fitting to noises with varying levels. To validate our proposed method, the quality of mimicking speech is evaluated in subjective listening experiments on similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness. In varying noise levels, the results show equal similarity with Lombard speech between the proposed method and a state-of-the-art method. Intelligibility and naturalness are comparable with some feature modifications.

DE argumentation structures; argumentative dialogue; dialogue generation;
   persuasiveness
AB Argumentation is a process of reaching a consensus through premises and rebuttals. If an artificial dialogue system can perform argumentation, it can improve users' decisions and ability to negotiate with the others. Previously, researchers have studied argumentative dialogue systems through a structured database regarding argumentation structure and evaluated the logical consistency of the dialogue. However, these systems could not change its response based on the user's agreement or disagreement to its last utterance. Furthermore, the persuasiveness of the generated dialogue has not been evaluated. In this study, a method is proposed to generate persuasive arguments through a hierarchical argumentation structure that considers human agreement and disagreement. Persuasiveness is evaluated through a crowd sourcing platform wherein participants' written impressions of shown dialogue texts are scored via a third person Likert scale evaluation. The proposed method was compared to the baseline method wherein argument response texts were generated without consideration of the user's agreement or disagreement. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method can generate a more persuasive dialogue than the baseline method. Further analysis implied that perceived persuasiveness was induced by evaluations of the behavior of the dialogue system, which was inherent in the hierarchical argumentation structure.

AB We have developed a digital watermarking method that use neural networks to learn embedding and extraction processes that are robust against rotation and JPEG compression. The proposed neural networks consist of a stego-image generator, a watermark extractor, a stego-image discriminator, and an attack simulator. The attack simulator consists of a rotation layer and an additive noise layer, which simulate the rotation attack and the JPEG compression attack, respectively. The stego-image generator can learn embedding that is robust against these attacks, and also, the watermark extractor can extract watermarks without rotation synchronization. The quality of the stego-images can be improved by using the stego-image discriminator, which is a type of adversarial network. We evaluated the robustness of the watermarks and image quality and found that, using the proposed method, high-quality stego-images could be generated and the neural networks could be trained to embed and extract watermarks that are robust against rotation and JPEG compression attacks. We also showed that the robustness and image quality can be adjusted by changing the noise strength in the noise layer.

AB Inter-node communication is essential in parallel computation. The performance of parallel processing depends on the efficiencies in both computation and communication, thus, the communication cost is not negligible. A parallel application program involves a logical communication structure that is determined by the interchange of data between computation nodes. Sometimes the logical communication structure mismatches to that in a real parallel machine. This mismatch results in large communication costs. This paper addresses the node-mapping problem that rearranges logical position of node so that the degree of mismatch is decreased. This paper assumes that parallel programs execute one or more collective communications that follow specific traffic patterns. An appropriate node-mapping achieves high communication performance. This paper proposes a strong heuristic method for solving the node-mapping problem and adapts the method to a genetic algorithm. Evaluation results reveal that the proposed method achieves considerably high performance; it achieves 8.9 (4.9) times speed-up on average in single-(two-)traffic-pattern cases in 32 x 32 torus networks. Specifically, for some traffic patterns in small-scale networks, the proposed method finds theoretically optimized solutions. Furthermore, this paper discusses in deep about various issues in the proposed method that employs genetic algorithm, such as population of genes, number of generations, and traffic patterns. This paper also discusses applicability to large-scale systems for future practical use.

ID ISING-MODEL
AB An annealing processor based on the Ising model is a remarkable candidate for combinatorial optimization problems and it is superior to general von Neumann computers. CMOS-based implementations of the annealing processor are efficient and feasible based on current semiconductor technology. However, critical problems with annealing processors remain. There are few simulated spins and inflexibility in terms of implementable graph topology due to hardware constraints. A prior approach to overcoming these problems is to emulate a complicated graph on a simple and high-density spin array with so-called minor embedding, a spin duplication method based on graph theory. When a complicated graph is embedded on such hardware, numerous spins are consumed to represent high-degree spins by combining multiple low-degree spins. In addition to the number of spins, the quality of solutions decreases as a result of dummy strong connections between the duplicated spins. Thus, the approach cannot handle large-scale practical problems. This paper proposes a flexible and scalable hardware architecture with time-division multiplexing for massive spins and high-degree topologies. A target graph is separated and mapped onto multiple virtual planes, and each plane is subject to interleaved simulation with time-division processing. Therefore, the behavior of high-degree spins is efficiently emulated over time, so that no dummy strong connections are required, and the solution quality is accordingly improved. We implemented a prototype hardware design for FPGAs, and we evaluated the proposed method in a software-based annealing processor simulator. The results indicate that the method increased the spins that can be deployed. In addition, our time-division multiplexing architecture improved the solution quality and convergence time with reasonable resource consumption.

AB Recently, many studies have applied gamification to software engineering education and software development to enhance work results. Gamification is defined as "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts." When applying gamification, we make various game rules, such as a time limit. However, it is not clear whether the rule affects working time or not. For example, if we apply a time limit to impatient developers, the working time may become shorter, but the rule may negatively affect because of pressure for time. In this study, we analyze with subjective experiments whether the rules affects work results such as working time. Our experimental results suggest that for the coding tasks, working time was shortened when we applied a rule that made developers aware of working time by showing elapsed time.

AB Since first introduced in 2008 with the 1.0 specification, OpenCL has steadily evolved over the decade to increase its support for heterogeneous parallel systems. In this paper, we accelerate stochastic simulation of biochemical reaction networks on modern GPUs (graphics processing units) by means of the OpenCL programming language. In implementing the OpenCL version of the stochastic simulation algorithm, we carefully apply its data-parallel execution model to optimize the performance provided by the underlying hardware parallelism of the modern GPUs. To evaluate our OpenCL implementation of the stochastic simulation algorithm, we perform a comparative analysis in terms of the performance using the CPU-based cluster implementation and the NVidia CUDA implementation. In addition to the initial report on the performance of OpenCL on GPUs, we also discuss applicability and programmability of OpenCL in the context of GPU-based scientific computing.

TI A Trend-Shift Model for Global Factor Analysis of Investment Products
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE factor analysis; state space model; trend detection
AB Recently, more and more people start investing. Understanding the factors affecting financial products is important for making investment decisions. However, it is difficult to understand factors for novices because various factors affect each other. Various technique has been studied, but conventional factor analysis methods focus on revealing the impact of factors over a certain period locally, and it is not easy to predict net asset values. As a reasonable solution for the prediction of net asset values, in this paper, we propose a trend shift model for the global analysis of factors by introducing trend change points as shift interference variables into state space models. In addition, to realize the trend shift model efficiently, we propose an effective trend detection method, TP-TBSM (two-phase TBSM), by extending TBSM (trend-based segmentation method). Comparing with TBSM, TP-TBSM could detect trends flexibly by reducing the dependence on parameters. We conduct experiments with eleven investment trust products and reveal the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model and method.

TI Super-Node Based Detection of Redundant Ontology Relations
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE ontology; super-node theory; redundant relation; redundancy elimination
AB Redundant relations refer to explicit relations which can also be deducted implicitly. Although there exist several ontology redundancy elimination methods, they all do not take equivalent relations into consideration. Actually, real ontologies usually contain equivalent relations; their redundancies cannot be completely detected by existing algorithms. Aiming at solving this problem, this paper proposes a super-node based ontology redundancy elimination algorithm. The algorithm consists of super-node transformation and transitive redundancy elimination. During the super-node transformation process, nodes equivalent to each other are transferred into a super-node. Then by deleting the overlapped edges, redundancies relating to equivalent relations are eliminated. During the transitive redundancy elimination process, redundant relations are eliminated by comparing concept nodes' direct and indirect neighbors. Most notably, we proposed a theorem to validate real ontology's irredundancy. Our algorithm outperforms others on both real ontologies and synthetic dynamic ontologies.

AB Machine learning algorithms are becoming more and more popular in current era. Data preprocessing especially feature selection is helpful for improving the performance of those algorithms. A new powerful feature selection algorithm is proposed. It combines the advantages of ant colony optimization and brain storm optimization which simulates the behavior of human beings. Six classical datasets and five state-of-art algorithms are used to make a comparison with our algorithm on binary classification problems. The results on accuracy, percent rate, recall rate, and F1 measures show that the developed algorithm is more excellent. Besides, it is no more complex than the compared approaches.

AB We propose a method to find assembly models contained in another assembly model given as a query from a set of 3D CAD assembly models. A 3D CAD assembly model consists of multiple components and is constructed using a 3D CAD software. The proposed method distinguishes assembly models which consist of a subset of components constituting the query model and also whose components have the same layout as the subset of the components. We compute difference between the shapes and the layouts of the components from the sinograms which are constructed by the Radon transform of their projections from various angles. We evaluate the proposed method experimentally using the assembly models which we prepare as a benchmark. The proposed method can also be used to find the database models which contains a query model.

TI File Systems are Hard to Test - Learning from Xfstests
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE file system; code coverage; software test
AB Modern file systems, such as ext4, btrfs, and XFS, are evolving and enable the introduction of new features to meet ever-changing demands and improve reliability. File system developers are struggling to eliminate all software bugs, but the operating system community points out that file systems are a hotbed of critical software bugs. This paper analyzes the code coverage of xfstests, a widely used suite of file system tests, on three major file systems (ext4, btrfs, and XFS). The coverage is 72.34%, and the uncovered code runs into 23,232 lines of code. To understand why the code coverage is low, the uncovered code is manually examined line by line. We identified three major causes, peculiar to file systems, that hinder higher coverage. First, covering all the features is difficult because each file system provides a wide variety of file-system specific features, and some features can be tested only on special storage devices. Second, covering all the execution paths is difficult because they depend on file system configurations and internal on-disk states. Finally, the code for maintaining backward-compatibility is executed only when a file system encounters old formats. Our findings will help file system developers improve the coverage of test suites and provide insights into fostering the development of new methodologies for testing file systems.

AB This paper proposes a method to absorb flash crowd in P2P video streaming systems. The idea of the proposed method is to reduce the time before a newly arrived node becoming an uploader by explicitly constructing a group of newly arrived nodes called flash crowd absorber (FCA). FCA grows continuously while serving a video stream to the members of the group, and it is explicitly controlled so that the upload capacity of the nodes is fully utilized and it attains a nearly optimal latency of the stream during a flash crowd. A numerical comparison with a naive tree-based scheme is also given.

ID RECOGNITION
AB We propose a method for accurately identifying people using temporal and spatial changes in local movements measured from video sequences of body sway. Existing methods identify people using gait features that mainly represent the large swinging of the limbs. The use of gait features introduces a problem in that the identification performance decreases when people stop walking and maintain an upright posture. To extract informative features, our method measures small swings of the body, referred to as body sway. We extract the power spectral density as a feature from local body sway movements by dividing the body into regions. To evaluate the identification performance using our method, we collected three original video datasets of body sway sequences. The first dataset contained a large number of participants in an upright posture. The second dataset included variation over the long term. The third dataset represented body sway in different postures. The results on the datasets confirmed that our method using local movements measured from body sway can extract informative features for identification.

AB 360-degree video is an important component of the emerging Virtual Reality. In this paper, we propose a new adaptation method for tiling-based viewport adaptive streaming of 360-degree video. The proposed method is able to dynamically select the best tiling scheme given the network conditions and user status. Experiments show that our proposed method can improve the viewport quality by up to 2.3 dB compared to a conventional fixed tiling method.

AB Extreme multi-label classification methods have been widely used inWeb-scale classification tasks such as Web page tagging and product recommendation. In this paper, we present a novel graph embedding method called "AnnexML". At the training step, AnnexML constructs a k-nearest neighbor graph of label vectors and attempts to reproduce the graph structure in the embedding space. The prediction is efficiently performed by using an approximate nearest neighbor search method that efficiently explores the learned k-nearest neighbor graph in the embedding space. We conducted evaluations on several large-scale real-world data sets and compared our method with recent state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our AnnexML can significantly improve prediction accuracy, especially on data sets that have a larger label space. In addition, AnnexML improves the trade-off between prediction time and accuracy. At the same level of accuracy, the prediction time of AnnexML was up to 58 times faster than that of SLEEC, a state-of-the-art embedding-based method.

AB We have proposed a fish farm monitoring system for achieving efficient fish farming. In our system, sensor nodes are attached at fish to monitor its health status. In this letter, we propose a method for gathering sensor data from sensor nodes to sink nodes when the transmission range of sensor node is shorter than the size of fish cage. In our proposed method, a part of sensor nodes become leader nodes and they forward gathered sensor data to the sink nodes. Through simulation evaluations, we show that the data gathering performance of our proposed method is higher than that of traditional methods.

AB Modeling user activities on the Web is a key problem for various Web services, such as news article recommendation and ad click prediction. In our work-in-progress paper[1], we introduced an approach that summarizes each sequence of user Web page visits using Paragraph Vector [3], considering users and URLs as paragraphs and words, respectively. The learned user representations are used among the user-related prediction tasks in common. In this paper, on the basis of analysis of our Web page visit data, we propose Backward PV-DM, which is a modified version of Paragraph Vector. We show experimental results on two ad-related data sets based on logs from Web services of Yahoo! JAPAN. Our proposed method achieved better results than those of existing vector models.

TI Optimization of Body Biasing for Variable Pipelined Coarse-Grained
   Reconfigurable Architectures
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE CGRA; body bias; power reduction; Cool Mega Array
AB Variable Pipeline Cool Mega Array (VPCMA) is a low power Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) based on the concept of CMA (Cool Mega Array). It provides a pipeline structure in the PE array that can be configured so as to fit target algorithms and required performance. Also, VPCMA uses the Silicon On Thin Buried oxide (SOTB) technology, a type of Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator (FD-SOI), so it is possible to control its body bias voltage to provide a balance between performance and leakage power. In this paper, we study the optimization of the VPCMA body bias while considering simultaneously its variable pipeline structure. Through evaluations, we can observe that it is possible to achieve an average reduction of energy consumption, for the studied applications, of 17.75% and 10.49% when compared to respectively the zero bias (without body bias control) and the uniform (control of the whole PE array) cases, while respecting performance constraints. Besides, it is observed that, with appropriate body bias control, it is possible to extend the possible performance, hence enabling broader trade-off analyzes between consumption and performance. Considering the dynamic power as well as the static power, more appropriate pipeline structure and body bias voltage can be obtained. In addition, when the control of VDD is integrated, higher performance can be achieved with a steady increase of the power. These promising results show that applying an adequate optimization technique for the body bias control while simultaneously considering pipeline structures can not only enable further power reduction than previous methods, but also allow more trade-off analysis possibilities.

DE bearing only target motion analysis; RANSAC; least squares
AB Most conventional research on target motion analysis (TMA) based on least squares (LS) has focused on performing asymptotically unbiased estimation with inaccurate measurements. However, such research may often yield inaccurate estimation results when only a small set of measurement data is used. In this paper, we propose an accurate TMA method even with a small set of bearing measurements. First, a subset of measurements is selected by a random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Then, LS is applied to the selected subset to estimate target motion. Finally, to increase accuracy, the target motion estimation is refined through a bias compensation algorithm. Simulated results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB As the manual creation of domain models and also of linked data is very costly, the extraction of knowledge from structured and unstructured data has been one of the central research areas in the Semantic Web field in the last two decades. Here, we look specifically at the extraction of formalized knowledge from natural language text, which is the most abundant source of human knowledge available. There are many tools on hand for information and knowledge extraction for English natural language, for written Thai language the situation is different. The goal of this work is to assess the state-of-the-art of research on formal knowledge extraction specifically from Thai language text, and then give suggestions and practical research ideas on how to improve the state-of-the-art. To address the goal, first we distinguish nine knowledge extraction for the Semantic Web tasks defined in literature on knowledge extraction from English text, for example taxonomy extraction, relation extraction, or named entity recognition. For each of the nine tasks, we analyze the publications and tools available for Thai text in the form of a comprehensive literature survey. Additionally to our assessment, we measure the self-assessment by the Thai research community with the help of a questionnaire-based survey on each of the tasks. Furthermore, the structure and size of the Thai community is analyzed using complex literature database queries. Combining all the collected information we finally identify research gaps in knowledge extraction from Thai language. An extensive list of practical research ideas is presented, focusing on concrete suggestions for every knowledge extraction task - which can be implemented and evaluated with reasonable effort. Besides the task-specific hints for improvements of the state-of-the-art, we also include general recommendations on how to raise the efficiency of the respective research community.

AB This paper proposes a classification method of second-language-learner utterances for interactive computer-assisted language learning systems. This classification method uses three types of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores as features for a classifier. The three BLEU scores are calculated in accordance with three subsets of a learner corpus divided according to the quality of utterances. For the purpose of overcoming the data-sparseness problem, this classification method uses the BLEU scores calculated using a mixture of word and part-of-speech (POS)-tag sequences converted from word sequences based on a POS-replacement rule according to which words are replaced with POS tags in n-grams. Experiments of classifying English utterances by Japanese demonstrated that the proposed classification method achieved classification accuracy of 78.2% which was 12.3 points higher than a baseline with one BLEU score.

DE CAPTCHA; generative adversarial network; deep convolutional network
AB We propose new CAPTCHA image generation systems by using generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques to strengthen against CAPTCHA solvers. To verify whether a user is human, CAPTCHA images are widely used on the web industry today. We introduce two different systems for generating CAPTCHA images, namely, the distance GAN (D-GAN) and composite GAN (C-GAN). The D-GAN adds distance values to the original CAPTCHA images to generate new ones, and the C-GAN generates a CAPTCHA image by composing multiple source images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes, we used the CAPTCHA breaker software as CAPTCHA solver. Then, we compared the resistance of the original source images and the generated CAPTCHA images against the CAPTCHA solver. The results show that the proposed schemes improve the resistance to the CAPTCHA solver by over 67.1% and 89.8% depending on the system.

AB This paper presents a method to segment single- and multiple-touching characters in offline handwritten Japanese text recognition with practical speed. Distortions due to handwriting and a mix of complex Chinese characters with simple phonetic and alphanumeric characters leave optical handwritten text recognition (OHTR) for Japanese still far from perfection. Segmentation of characters, which touch neighbors on multiple points, is a serious unsolved problem. Therefore, we propose a method to segment them which is made in two steps: coarse segmentation and fine segmentation. The coarse segmentation employs vertical projection, stroke-width estimation while the fine segmentation takes a graph-based approach for thinned text images, which employs a new bridge finding process and Voronoi diagrams with two improvements. Unlike previous methods, it locates character centers and seeks segmentation candidates between them. It draws vertical lines explicitly at estimated character centers in order to prevent vertically unconnected components from being left behind in the bridge finding. Multiple candidates of separation are produced by removing touching points combinatorially. SVM is applied to discard improbable segmentation boundaries. Then, ambiguities are finally solved by the text recognition employing linguistic context and geometric context to recognize segmented characters. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method can segment not only single-touching characters but also multiple-touching characters, and each component in our proposed method contributes to the improvement of segmentation and recognition rates.

AB We propose a method for embedding the awareness state and response state in an image-based avatar to smoothly and automatically start an interaction with a user. When both states are not embedded, the image-based avatar can become non-responsive or slow to respond. To consider the beginning of an interaction, we observed the behaviors between a user and receptionist in an information center. Our method replayed the behaviors of the receptionist at appropriate times in each state of the image-based avatar. Experimental results demonstrate that, at the beginning of the interaction, our method for embedding the awareness state and response state increased subjective scores more than not embedding the states.

TI Query Rewriting or Ontology Modification? Toward a Faster Approximate
   Reasoning on LOD Endpoints
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE semantic web; SPARQL; inference
AB On an inference-enabled Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoint, usually a query execution takes longer than on an LOD endpoint without inference engine due to its processing of reasoning. Although there are two separate kind of approaches, query modification approaches, and ontology modifications have been investigated on the different contexts, there have been discussions about how they can be chosen or combined for various settings. In this paper, for reducing query execution time on an inference-enabled LOD endpoint, we compare these two promising methods: query rewriting and ontology modification, as well as trying to combine them into a cluster of such systems. We employ an evolutionary approach to make such rewriting and modification of queries and ontologies based on the past-processed queries and their results. We show how those two approaches work well on implementing an inference-enabled LOD endpoint by a cluster of SPARQL endpoints.

AB In this paper, we propose a similarity searchable encryption in the symmetric key setting for the weighted Euclidean distance, by extending the functional encryption scheme for inner product proposed by Bishop et al. [4]. Our scheme performs predetermined encoding independently of vectors x and y, and it obtains the weighted Euclidean distance between the two vectors while they remain encrypted.

ID MOBILE DEVICES
AB With the rapid spread of smart devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs, user authentication is becoming increasingly important because various kinds of data concerning user privacy are processed within them. At present, in the case of smart devices, password-based authentication is frequently used; however, biometric authentication has attracted more attention as a user authentication technology. A smart device is equipped with various sensors, such as cameras, microphones, and touch panels, many of which enable biometric information to be obtained. While the function of biometric authentication is available in many smart devices, there remain some problems to be addressed for more secure and convenient user authentication. In this paper, we summarize the current problems with user authentication on smart devices and propose a novel user authentication system based on the concept of context awareness to resolve these problems. We also present our evaluation of the performance of the system by using biometric information that was acquired from smart devices. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our system.

DT Article
DE recommender system; behavior analysis; temporal dynamics; session
AB In the era of e-commerce, purchase behavior prediction is one of the most important issues to promote both online companies' sales and the consumers' experience. The previous researches usually use traditional features based on the statistics and temporal dynamics of items. Those features lead to the loss of detailed items' information. In this study, we propose a novel kind of features based on temporally popular items to improve the prediction. Experiments on the real-world dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed method. Features based on temporally popular items are compared with traditional features which are associated with statistics, temporal dynamics and collaborative filter of items. We find that temporally popular items are an effective and irreplaceable supplement of traditional features. Our study shed light on the effectiveness of the combination of popularity and temporal dynamics of items which can widely used for a variety of recommendations in e-commerce sites.

TI Building a Scalable Web Tracking Detection System: Implementation and

DE web tracking; web browser fingerprint
AB Web tracking is widely used as a means to track user's behavior on websites. While web tracking provides new opportunities of e-commerce, it also includes certain risks such as privacy infringement. Therefore, analyzing such risks in the wild Internet is meaningful to make the user's privacy transparent. This work aims to understand how the web tracking has been adopted to prominent websites. We also aim to understand their resilience to the ad-blocking techniques. Web tracking-enabled websites collect the information called the web browser fingerprints, which can be used to identify users. We develop a scalable system that can detect fingerprinting by using both dynamic and static analyses. If a tracking site makes use of many and strong fingerprints, the site is likely resilient to the ad-blocking techniques. We also analyze the connectivity of the third-party tracking sites, which are linked from multiple websites. The link analysis allows us to extract the group of associated tracking sites and understand how influential these sites are. Based on the analyses of 100,000 websites, we quantify the potential risks of the web tracking-enabled websites. We reveal that there are 226 websites that adopt fingerprints that cannot be detected with the most of off-the-shelf anti-tracking tools. We also reveal that a major, resilient third-party tracking site is linked to 50.0 % of the top-100,000 popular websites.

TI Well-Balanced Successive Simple-9 for Inverted Lists Compression

AB The growth in the amount of information available on the Internet and thousands of user queries per second brings huge challenges to the index update and query processing of search engines. Index compression is partially responsible for the current performance achievements of existing search engines. The selection of the index compression algorithms must weigh three factors, i.e., compression ratio, compression speed and decompression speed. In this paper, we study the well-known Simple-9 compression, in which exist many branch operations, table lookup and data transfer operations when processing each 32-bit machine word. To enhance the compression and decompression performance of Simple-9 algorithm, we propose a successive storage structure and processing metric to compress two successive Simple-9 encoded sequence of integers in a single data processing procedure, thus the name Successive Simple-9 (SSimple-9). In essence, the algorithm shortens the process of branch operations, table lookup and data transfer operations when compressing the integer sequence. More precisely, we initially present the data storage format and mask table of SSimple-9 algorithm. Then, for each mode in the mask table, we design and hard-code the main steps of the compression and decompression processes. Finally, analysis and comparison on the experimental results of the simulation and TREC datasets show the compression and decompression efficiency speedup of the proposed SSimple-9 algorithm.

AB This paper presents an ontology-based driving decision making system, which can promptly make safety decisions in real-world driving. Analyzing sensor data for improving autonomous driving safety has become one of the most promising issues in the autonomous vehicles research field. However, representing the sensor data in a machine understandable format for further knowledge processing still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce ontologies designed for autonomous vehicles and ontology-based knowledge base, which are used for representing knowledge of maps, driving paths, and perceived driving environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are developed to improve safety of autonomous vehicles by accessing to the ontology-based knowledge base. The ontologies can be reused and extended for constructing knowledge base for autonomous vehicles as well as for implementing different types of ADAS such as decision making system.

In the use of a common computer mouse for tabletop displays, there might be an angular distance between the screen coordinates and the mouse control coordinates. To align those coordinates, this paper introduces a screen coordinates calibration technique using a shadow cursor. A shadow cursor is the basic idea of manipulating a mouse cursor without any visual feedbacks. The shadow cursor plays an important role in obtaining the angular distance between the two coordinates. It enables the user to perform a simple mouse manipulation so that screen coordinates calibration will be completed in less than a second.

AB In this paper, we consider a networked control system where bounded network delays and packet dropouts exist in the network. The physical plant is abstracted by a transition system whose states are quantized states of the plant measured by a sensor, and a control specification for the abstracted plant is given by a transition system when no network disturbance occurs. Then, we design a prediction-based controller that determines a control input by predicting a set of all feasible abstracted states at time when the actuator receives the delayed input. It is proved that the prediction-based controller suppresses effects of network delays and packet dropouts and that the controlled plant still achieves the specification in spite of the existence of network delays and packet dropouts.

AB In general, semi-supervised clustering can outperform unsupervised clustering. Since 2001, pairwise constraints for semi-supervised clustering have been an important paradigm in this field. In this paper, we show that pairwise constraints (ECs) can affect the performance of clustering in certain situations and analyze the reasons for this in detail. To overcome these disadvantages, we first outline some exemplars constraints. Based on these constraints, we then describe a semi-supervised clustering framework, and design an exemplars constraints expectation-maximization algorithm. Finally, standard datasets are selected for experiments, and experimental results are presented, which show that the exemplars constraints outperform the corresponding unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised algorithms based on pairwise constraints.

AB In tutoring systems, students are more likely to utilize hints to assist their decisions about difficult or confusing problems. In the meanwhile, students with weaker knowledge mastery tend to choose more hints than others with stronger knowledge mastery. Hints are important assistances to help students deal with questions. Students can learn from hints and enhance their knowledge about questions. In this paper we firstly use hints alone to build a model named Hints-Model to predict student performance. In addition, matrix factorization (MF) has been prevalent in educational fields to predict student performance, which is derived from their success in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems (RS). While there is another factorization method named non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) which has been developed over one decade, and has additional non-negative constrains on the factorization matrices. Considering the sparseness of the original matrix and the efficiency, we can utilize an element-based matrix factorization called regularized single-element-based NMF (RSNMF). We compared the results of different factorization methods to their combination with Hints-Model. From the experiment results on two datasets, we can find the combination of RSNMF with Hints-Model has achieved significant improvement and obtains the best result. We have also compared the Hints-Model with the pioneer approach performance factor analysis (PFA), and the outcomes show that the former method exceeds the later one.

AB With the popularization of Internet of things( IoT), the interaction between human and IoT has become a daily life. In this interaction, the objects of IoT usually require access to personal data, which are often sensitive. We propose a lightweight privacy-preserving model based on the trust evaluation that it can effectively protect privacy based on simple threshold detection. The key issue we address in this work is how to construct trust model so that non trusted objects were prevented from accessing private data. This work can be considered as a lightweight approach to access control for privacy-preservation. The main algorithm in the proposed model is a kind of dynamic self-adjusting trust evaluation mechanism that uses a combination of interaction information occurs between the human and the Internet of things, between the human and the human. According to the given threshold, the trust model can determine the data level of object access in the IoT. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed scheme, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed scheme on resource-constrained devices.

AB Mobile traffic is experiencing tremendous growth, and this growing wave is no doubt increasing the use of radio component of mobile devices, resulting in shorter battery lifetime. In this paper, we present an Energy-Aware Download Method (EDM) based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to optimize the data download energy for mobile applications. Unlike the previous download schemes in literature that focus on the energy efficiency by simply delaying the download requests, which often leads to a poor user experience, our MDP model learns off-line from a set of training download workloads for different user patterns. The model is then integrated into the mobile application to deal the download request at runtime, taking into account the current battery level, LTE reference signal receiving power (RSRP), reference signal signal to noise radio (RSSNR) and task size as input of the decision process, and maximizes the reward which refers to the expected battery life and user experience. We evaluate how the EDM can be used in the context of a real file downloading application over the LTE network. We obtain, on average, 20.3%, 15% and 45% improvement respectively for energy consumption, latency, and performance of energy-delay trade off, when compared to the Android default download policy (Minimum Delay).

AB Class imbalance has drawn much attention of researchers in software defect prediction. In practice, the performance of defect prediction models may be affected by the class imbalance problem. In this paper, we present an approach to evaluating the performance stability of defect prediction models on imbalanced datasets. First, random sampling is applied to convert the original imbalanced dataset into a set of new datasets with different levels of imbalance ratio. Second, typical prediction models are selected to make predictions on these new constructed datasets, and Coefficient of Variation (C.V) is used to evaluate the performance stability of different models. Finally, an empirical study is designed to evaluate the performance stability of six prediction models, which are widely used in software defect prediction. The results show that the performance of C4.5 is unstable on imbalanced datasets, and the performance of Naive Bayes and Random Forest are more stable than other models.

TI Cache-Aware GPU Optimization for Out-of-Core Cone Beam CT Reconstruction
   of High-Resolution Volumes
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE cone beam reconstruction; GPU; CUDA; cache optimization
ID X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY
AB This paper proposes a cache-aware optimization method to accelerate out-of-core cone beam computed tomography reconstruction on a graphics processing unit (GPU) device. Our proposed method extends a previous method by increasing the cache hit rate so as to speed up the reconstruction of high-resolution volumes that exceed the capacity of device memory. More specifically, our approach accelerates the well-known Feldkamp-Davis-Kress algorithm by utilizing the following three strategies: (1) a loop organization strategy that identifies the best tradeoff point between the cache hit rate and the number of off-chip memory accesses; (2) a data structure that exploits high locality within a layered texture; and (3) a fully pipelined strategy for hiding file input/output (I/O) time with GPU execution and data transfer times. We implement our proposed method on NVIDIA's latest Maxwell architecture and provide tuning guidelines for adjusting the execution parameters, which include the granularity and shape of thread blocks as well as the granularity of I/O data to be streamed through the pipeline, which maximizes reconstruction performance. Our experimental results show that it took less than three minutes to reconstruct a 2048(3)-voxel volume from 1200 2048(2)-pixel projection images on a single GPU; this translates to a speedup of approximately 1.47 as compared to the previous method.

TI Reliability and Failure Impact Analysis of Distributed Storage Systems

AB In recent data centers, large-scale storage systems storing big data comprise thousands of large-capacity drives. Our goal is to establish a method for building highly reliable storage systems using more than a thousand low-cost large-capacity drives. Some large-scale storage systems protect data by erasure coding to prevent data loss. As the redundancy level of erasure coding is increased, the probability of data loss will decrease, but the increase in normal data write operation and additional storage for coding will be incurred. We therefore need to achieve high reliability at the lowest possible redundancy level. There are two concerns regarding reliability in large-scale storage systems: ( i) as the number of drives increases, systems are more subject to multiple drive failures and ( ii) distributing stripes among many drives can speed up the rebuild time but increase the risk of data loss due to multiple drive failures. If data loss occurs by multiple drive failure, it affects many users using a storage system. These concerns were not addressed in prior quantitative reliability studies based on realistic settings. In this work, we analyze the reliability of large-scale storage systems with distributed stripes, focusing on an effective rebuild method which we call Dynamic Refuging. Dynamic Refuging rebuilds failed blocks from those with the lowest redundancy and strategically selects blocks to read for repairing lost data. We modeled the dynamic change of amount of storage at each redundancy level caused by multiple drive failures, and performed reliability analysis with Monte Carlo simulation using realistic drive failure characteristics. We showed a failure impact model and a method for localizing the failure. When stripes with redundancy level 3 were sufficiently distributed and rebuilt by Dynamic Refuging, the proposed technique turned out to scale well, and the probability of data loss decreased by two orders of magnitude for systems with a thousand drives compared to normal RAID. The appropriate setting of a stripe distribution level could localize the failure.

AB By the deployment of Internet of Things, embedded systems using microcontroller are nowadays under threats through the network and incorporating security measure to the systems is highly required. Unfortunately, microcontrollers are not so powerful enough to execute standard security programs and need light-weight, high-speed and secure cryptographic libraries. In this paper, we port NaCl cryptographic library to ARM Cortex-M0(M0+) Microcontroller, where we put much effort in fast and secure implementation. Through the evaluation we show that the implementation achieves about 3 times faster than AVR NaCl result and reduce half of the code size.

AB Buffer overflow is one of the main approaches to get control of vulnerable programs. This paper presents a protection technique called BFWindow for performance and resource sensitive embedded systems. By coloring data structure in memory with single associate property bit to each byte and extending the target memory block to a BFWindow(2), it validates each memory write by speculatively checking consistency of data properties within the extended buffer window. Property bits are generated by compiler statically and checked by hardware at runtime. They are transparent to users. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is effective to prevent sequential memory writes from crossing buffer boundaries which is the common scenario of buffer overflow exploitations. The performance overhead for practical protection mode across embedded system benchmarks is under 1%.

AB A non-linear extension of generalized hyperplane approximation ( GHA) method is introduced in this letter. Although GHA achieved a high-confidence result in motion parameter estimation by utilizing the supervised learning scheme in histogram of oriented gradient ( HOG) feature space, it still has unstable convergence range because it approximates the non-linear function of regression from the feature space to the motion parameter space as a linear plane. To extend GHA into a non-linear regression for larger convergence range, we derive theoretical equations and verify this extension's effectiveness and efficiency over GHA by experimental results.

AB The cycling wheelchair "Profhand" was developed in Japan as locomotion and lower limb rehabilitation device for hemiplegic subjects and elderly persons. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) control of paralyzed lower limbs enables application of the Profhand to paraplegic subjects as a rehabilitation device. In this paper, simplified muscle stimulation control for FES cycling with Profhand was examined for practical application, because cycling speed was low and not stable in our preliminary study and there was a difficulty in setting stimulation electrodes for the gluteus maximus. First, a guideline of target cycling speed to be achieved by FES cycling was determined from voluntary cycling with healthy subjects in order to evaluate FES cycling control. The cycling speed of 0.6m/s was determined as acceptable value and 1.0m/s was as ideal one. Then, stimulation to the gluteus maximus and that to the dorsiflexor muscles in addition to the quadriceps femoris were examined for simple FES cycling control for Profhand with healthy subjects. Stimulation timing was adjusted automatically during cycling based on muscle response time to electrical stimulation and cycling speed, which was shown to be effective for FES cycling control. Simple FES cycling control with Profhand removing stimulation to the gluteus maximus was found to be feasible. Stimulation to the dorsiflexor muscles with the quadriceps femoris was suggested to be effective for practical, simple FES cycling with Profhand in case of removing the gluteus maximus stimulation.

ID BIAS ANALYSIS; EXTRACTION
AB To support the efficient gathering of diverse information about a news event, we focus on descriptions of named entities (persons, organizations, locations) in news articles. We extend the stakeholder mining proposed by Ogawa et al. and extract descriptions of named entities in articles. We propose three measures (difference in opinion, difference in details, and difference in factor coverage) to rank news articles on the basis of analyzing differences in descriptions of named entities. On the basis of these three measurements, we develop a news app on mobile devices to help users to acquire diverse reports for improving their understanding of the news. For the current article a user is reading, the proposed news app will rank and provide its related articles from different perspectives by the three ranking measurements. One of the notable features of our system is to consider the access history to provide the related news articles.

AB We consider a problem as follows: Given unit weights arriving in an online manner with the total cardinality unknown, upon each arrival we decide where to place it on the unit circle in R-2. The objective is to set the center of mass of the placed weights as close to the origin as possible. We apply competitive analysis defining the competitive difference as a performance measure. We first present an optimal strategy for placing unit weights which achieves a competitive difference of 1/5. We next consider a variant in which the destination of each weight must be chosen from a set of positions that equally divide the unit circle. We give a simple strategy whose competitive difference is 0.35. Moreover, in the offline setting, several conditions for the center of mass to lie at the origin are derived.

AB A Manhattan tower is a monotone orthogonal polyhedron lying in the halfspace z >= 0 such that (i) its intersection with the xy-plane is a simply connected orthogonal polygon, and (ii) the horizontal cross section at higher levels is nested in that for lower levels. Here, a monotone polyhedron meets each vertical line in a single segment or not at all. We study the computational complexity of finding the minimum number of guards which can observe the side and upper surfaces of a Manhattan tower. It is shown that the vertex-guarding, edge-guarding, and face-guarding problems for Manhattan towers are NP-hard.

ID MINIMIZATION
AB In this letter, an effective acoustic feedback cancellation algorithm is proposed based on the normalized sub-band adaptive filter (NSAF). To improve the confliction between fast convergence rate and low misalignment in the NSAF algorithm, a variable step size is designed to automatically vary according to the update state of the filter. The update state of the filter is adaptively detected via the normalized distance between the long term average and the short term average of the tap-weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has superior performance in terms of convergence rate and misalignment.

ID RESOURCE RESERVATION; WIRELESS; KURAMOTO
AB Wireless local area networks (LANs) based on the IEEE802.11 standard usually use carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) for media access control. However, in CSMA/CA, if the number of wireless terminals increases, the back-off time derived by the initial contention window (CW) tends to conflict among wireless terminals. Consequently, a data frame collision often occurs, which sometimes causes the degradation of the total throughput in the transport layer protocols. In this study, to improve the total throughput, we propose a new media access control method, SP-MAC, which is based on the synchronization phenomena of coupled oscillators. Moreover, this study shows that SP-MAC drastically decreases the data frame collision probability and improves the total throughput when compared with the original CSMA/CA method.

As a fundamental learning problem, we consider storage and stabilization of one desired binary periodic orbit that corresponds to control signals of switching circuits. For the storage, we present a simple method based on the correlation learning. For the stabilization, we present a sparsification method based on the mutation operation in the genetic algorithm. Using the Gray-code-based return map, the storage and stability can be investigated. Performing numerical experiments, effectiveness of the learning method is confirmed.

AB We propose an energy-efficient real-time scheduling algorithm based on T-L Plane abstraction. The algorithm is designed to exploit Dynamic Power Management and generates a new event called event-s to render longer idle intervals, which increases the chances of switching a processor to the sleep mode. We compare the proposed algorithm with previous work and show that it is effective for energy management.

DE encrypted database; secrecy; inference analysis; decidability
AB In this letter, we propose a secrecy criterion for outsourcing encrypted databases. In encrypted databases, encryption schemes revealing some information are often used in order to manipulate encrypted data efficiently. The proposed criterion is based on inference analysis for databases: We simulate attacker's inference on specified secret information with and without the revealed information from the encrypted database. When the two inference results are the same, then secrecy of the specified information is preserved against outsourcing the encrypted database. We also show that the proposed criterion is decidable under a practical setting.

TI Displacement Mapping with an Augmented Patch Mesh
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE displacement mapping; surface detail; depth map; vector displacement map
ID MAPS; SURFACES
AB Displacement mapping has been widely used for adding geometric surface details to 3D mesh models. However, it requires sufficient tessellation of the mesh if fine details are to be represented. In this paper, we propose a method for applying the displacement mapping even on coarse models by using an augmented patch mesh. The patch mesh is a regularly tessellated flat square mesh, which is mapped onto the target area. Our method applies displacement mapping to the patch mesh for fitting it to the original mesh as well as for adding surface details. We generate a patch map, which stores three-dimensional displacements from the patch mesh to the original mesh. A displacement map is also provided for defining the new surface feature. The target area in the original mesh is then replaced with the patch mesh, and the patch mesh reconstructs the original shape using the patch map and the new surface detail is added using the displacement map. Our results show that our method conveniently adds surface features to various models. The proposed method is particularly useful if the surface features change dynamically since the original mesh is preserved and the separate patch mesh overwrites the target area at runtime.

AB This paper presents a method to reduce I/O cost in MapReduce when online analytical processing (OLAP) queries are used for data analysis. The proposed method consists of two basic ideas. First, to reduce network transmission cost, mappers are organized to receive only data necessary to perform a map task, not an entire set of input data. Second, to reduce storage consumption, only record IDs are stored for checkpointing, not the raw records. Experiments conducted with TPC-H benchmark show that the proposed method is about 40% faster than Hive, the well-known data warehouse solution for MapReduce, while reducing the size of data stored for checkpoining to about 80%.

DE smartphone; download strategy; CLSA; energy-delay trade off
AB The endurance time of smartphone still suffer from the limited battery capacity, and smartphone apps will increase the burden of the battery if they download large data over slow network. So how to manage the download tasks is an important work. To this end we propose a smartphone download strategy with low energy consumption which called CLSA (Concentrated Download and Low Power and Stable Link Selection Algorithm). The CLSA is intended to reduce the overhead of large data downloads by appropriate delay for the smartphone, and it based on three major factors: the current network situation, the length of download requests' queue and the local information of smartphone. We evaluate the CLSA using a music player implementation on ZTE V880 smartphone running the Android operation system, and compare it with the other two general download strategies, Minimum Delay and WiFi Only. Experiments show that our download algorithm can achieve a better trade-off between energy and delay than the other two.

AB The recent development of communication devices and wireless network technologies continues to advance the new era of the Internet and telecommunications. The various "things", which include not only communication devices but also every other physical object on the planet, are also going to be connected to the Internet, and controlled through wireless networks. This concept, which is referred to as the "Internet of Things (IoT)", has attracted much attention from many researchers in recent years. The concept of IoT can be associated with multiple research areas such as body area networks, Device-to-Device (D2D) communications networks, home area networks, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, satellite networks, and so forth. Also, there are various kinds of applications created by using IoT technologies. Thus, the concept of the IoT is expected to be integrated into our society and support our daily life in the near future. In this paper, we introduce different classifications of IoT with examples of utilizing IoT technologies. In addition, as an example of a practical system using IoT, a tsunami detection system (which is composed of a satellite, sensor terminals, and an active monitoring system for real-time simultaneous utilization of the devices) is introduced. Furthermore, the requirements of the next generation systems with the IoT are delineated in the paper.

ID TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES
AB In this paper, we propose a texture descriptor based on amplitude distribution and phase distribution of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an image. One dimensional DFT is applied to all the rows and columns of an image. Histograms of the amplitudes and gradients of the phases between adjacent rows/columns are computed as the feature descriptor, which is called aggregated DFT (ADFT). ADFT can be easily combined with completed local binary pattern (CLBP). The combined feature captures both global and local information of the texture. ADFT is designed for isotropic textures and demonstrated to be effective for roughness classification of castings. Experimental results show that the amplitude part of ADFT is also discriminative in describing anisotropic textures and it can be used as a complementary descriptor of local texture descriptors such as CLBP.

AB A novel Two-dimensional Fuzzy Discriminant Locality Preserving Projections (2D-FDLPP) algorithm is proposed for learning effective subspace of two-dimensional images. The 2D-FDLPP algorithm is derived from the Two-dimensional Locality Preserving Projections (2D-LPP) by exploiting both fuzzy and discriminant properties. 2D-FDLPP algorithm preserves the relationship degree of each sample belonging to given classes with fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier. Also, it introduces between-class scatter constrain and label information into 2D-LPP algorithm. 2D-FDLPP algorithm finds the subspace which can best discriminate different pattern classes and weakens the environment factors according to soft assignment method. Therefore, 2D-FDLPP algorithm has more discriminant power than 2D-LPP, and is more suitable for recognition tasks. Experiments are conducted on the MNIST database for handwritten image classification, the JAFFE database and Cohn-Kanade database for facial expression recognition and the ORL database for face recognition. Experimental results reported the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

ID MODEL
AB A challenge faced by the video game industry is to develop believable and more intelligent Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). To tackle this problem a low-cost and simple approach has been proposed in this research, which is the development of a gossip virtual social network for NPCs. The network allows simple individual NPCs to communicate their knowledge amongst themselves. The communication within this social network is governed by social-psychological rules. These rules are categorized into four types: Contact, whether the NPC are within a contactable range of each other; Observation, whether the NPCs actually want to talk to each other based on their personal traits; Status, the current representation of the NPCs; and Relationships which determines the long term ties of the NPCs. Evaluations of the proposed gossip virtual social network was conducted, both through statistical analysis and a survey of real users. Highly satisfactory results have been achieved.

TI Creating Stories from Socially Curated Microblog Messages
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE social curation; microblogging; learning to rank
AB Social media such as microblogs have become so pervasive such that it is now possible to use them as sensors for real-world events and memes. While much recent research has focused on developing automatic methods for filtering and summarizing these data streams, we explore a different trend called social curation. In contrast to automatic methods, social curation is characterized as a human-in-the-loop and sometimes crowd-sourced mechanism for exploiting social media as sensors. Although social curation web services like Togetter, Naver Matome and Storify are gaining popularity, little academic research has studied the phenomenon. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the phenomenon and potential of this new field of social curation. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of curated tnicroblog data. We seek to understand why and how people participate in this laborious curation process. We then explore new ways in which information retrieval and machine learning technologies can be used to assist curators. In particular, we propose a novel method based on a learning-to-rank framework that increases the curator's productivity and breadth of perspective by suggesting which novel microblogs should be added to the curated content.

AB Recently, the wavelet-based estimation method has gradually been becoming popular as a new tool for software reliability assessment. The wavelet transform possesses both spatial and temporal resolution which makes the wavelet-based estimation method powerful in extracting necessary information from observed software fault data, in global and local points of view at the same time. This enables us to estimate the software reliability measures in higher accuracy. However, in the existing works, only the point estimation of the wavelet-based approach was focused, where the underlying stochastic process to describe the software-fault detection phenomena was modeled by a non-homogeneous Poisson process. In this paper, we propose an interval estimation method for the wavelet-based approach, aiming at taking account of uncertainty which was left out of consideration in point estimation. More specifically, we employ the simulation-based bootstrap method, and derive the confidence intervals of software reliability measures such as the software intensity function and the expected cumulative number of software faults. To this end, we extend the well-known thinning algorithm for the purpose of generating multiple sample data from one set of software-fault count data. The results of numerical analysis with real software fault data make it clear that, our proposal is a decision support method which enables the practitioners to do flexible decision making in software development project management.

AB Filter caches have been studied as an energy efficient solution. They achieve energy savings via selected access to L1 cache, but severely decrease system performance. Therefore, a filter cache system should adopt components that balance execution delay against energy savings. In this letter, we analyze the legacy filter cache system and propose Data Filter Cache with Partial Tag Cache (DFPC) as a new solution. The proposed DFPC scheme reduces energy consumption of L1 data cache and does not impair system performance at all. Simulation results show that DFPC provides the 46.36% energy savings without any performance loss.

TI Efficient Update Activation for Virtual Machines in IaaS Cloud Computing

DE Cloud computing; IaaS; virtual machines; software updates
AB Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), a form of cloud computing, is gaining attention for its ability to enable efficient server administration in dynamic workload environments. In such environments, however, updating the software stack or content files of virtual machines (VMs) is a time-consuming task, discouraging administrators from frequently enhancing their services and fixing security holes. This is because the administrator has to upload the whole new disk image to the cloud platform via the Internet, which is not yet fast enough that large amounts of data can be transferred smoothly. Although the administrator can apply incremental updates directly to the running VMs, he or she has to carefully consider the type of update and perform operations on all running VMs, such as application restarts. This is a tedious and error-prone task. This paper presents a technique for synchronizing VMs with less time and lower administrative burden. We introduce the Virtual Disk Image Repository, which runs on the cloud platform and automatically updates the virtual disk image and the running VMs with only the incremental update information. We also show a mechanism that performs necessary operations on the running VM such as restarting server processes, based on the types of files that are updated. We implement a prototype on Linux 2.6.31.14 and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. An experiment shows that our technique can synchronize VMs in an order-of-magnitude shorter time than the conventional disk-image-based VM method. Also, we discuss limitations of our technique and some directions for more efficient VM updates.

TI Scan Shift Time Reduction Using Test Compaction for On-Chip Delay
   Measurement
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE small-delay defects; test compaction; test application time; test data
   volume; on-chip delay measurement
AB In recent VLSIs, small-delay defects, which are hard to detect by traditional delay fault testing, can bring about serious issues such as short lifetime. To detect small-delay defects, on-chip delay measurement which measures the delay time of paths in the circuit under test (CUT) was proposed. However, this approach incurs high test cost because it uses scan design, which brings about long test application time due to scan shift operation. Our solution is a test application time reduction method for testing using the on-chip path delay measurement. The testing with on-chip path delay measurement does not require capture operations, unlike the conventional delay testing. Specifically, FFs keep the transition pattern of the test pattern pair sensitizing a path under measurement (PUM) (denoted as p) even after the measurement of p. The proposed method uses this characteristic. The proposed method reduces scan shift time and test data volume using test pattern merging. Evaluation results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits indicate that the proposed method reduces the test application time by 6.89 similar to 62.67% and test data volume by 46.39 similar to 74.86%.

TI Modeling Interactions between Low-Level and High-Level Features for
   Human Action Recognition

DE action recognition; camera position features; local spatio-temporal
   features; interactions
AB Recognizing human action in complex scenes is a challenging problem in computer vision. Some action-unrelated concepts, such as camera position features, could significantly affect the appearance of local spatio-temporal features, and therefore the performance of low-level features based methods degrades. In this letter, we define the action-unrelated concept: the position of camera as high-level features. We observe that they can serve as a prior to local spatio-temporal features for human action recognition. We encode this prior by modeling interactions between spatio-temporal features and camera position features. We infer camera position features from local spatio-temporal features via these interactions. The parameters of this model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. We evaluate the proposed method on KTH, IXMAS and Youtube actions datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE face recognition; sparse representation; collaborative representation;

AB For face recognition with a single training image per person, Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) has significantly less complexity than Extended Sparse Representation based Classification (ESRC). However, CRC gets lower recognition rates than ESRC. In order to combine the advantages of CRC and ESRC, we propose Extended Collaborative Representation based Classification (ECRC) for face recognition with a single training image per person. ECRC constructs an auxiliary intraclass variant dictionary to represent the possible variation between the testing and training images. Experimental results show that ECRC outperforms the compared methods in terms of both high recognition rates and low computation complexity.

TI A Method for Minimizing Clock Skew Fluctuations Caused by Interconnect
   Process Variations
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE clock skew; interconnect; process variation; signal delay
AB As the LSI process technology advances and the gate size becomes smaller, the signal delay on interconnect becomes a significant factor in the signal path delay. Also, as the size of interconnect structure becomes smaller, the interconnect process variations have become one of the dominant factors which influence the signal delay and thus clock skew. Therefore, controlling the influence of interconnect process variations on clock skew is a crucial issue in the advanced process technologies. In this paper, we propose a method for minimizing clock skew fluctuations caused by interconnect process variations. The proposed method identifies the suitable balance of clock buffer size and wire length in order to minimize the clock skew fluctuations caused by the interconnect process variations. Experimental results on test circuits of 28 nm process technology show that the proposed method reduces the clock skew fluctuations by 30-92% compared to the conventional method.

TI Efficient Large-Scale Video Retrieval via Discriminative Signatures

AB The topic of retrieving videos containing a desired person from a dataset just using the content of faces without any help of textual information has many interesting applications like video surveillance, social network, video mining, etc. However, traditional face matching against a huge number of detected faces leads to an unacceptable response time and may also reduce the accuracy due to the large variations in facial expressions, poses, lighting, etc. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel method to generate discriminative "signatures" for efficiently retrieving the videos containing the same person with a query. In this research, the signature is defined as a compact, discriminative and reduced dimensionality representation, which is generated from a set of high-dimensional feature vectors of an individual. The desired videos are retrieved based on the similarities between the signature of the query and those of individuals in the database. In particular, we make the following contributions. Firstly, we give an algorithm of two directional linear discriminant analysis with maximum correntropy criterion (2DLDA-MCC) as an extension to our recently proposed maximum correntropy criterion based linear discriminant analysis (LDA-MCC). Both algorithms are robust to outliers and noise. Secondly, we present an approach for transferring a set of exemplars to a fixed-length signature using LDA-MCC and 2DLDA-MCC, resulting in two kinds of signatures that are called ID signature and 2D signature. Finally, a novel video retrieval scheme is given based on the signatures, which has low storage requirement and can achieve a fast search. Evaluations on a large dataset of videos show reliable measurement of similarities by using the proposed signatures to represent the identities generated from videos. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed video retrieval scheme has the potential to substantially reduce the response time and slightly increase the mean average precision of retrieval.

AB We propose a retrieval method using scale invariant visual phrases (SIVPs). Our method encodes spatial information into the SIVPs which capture translation, rotation and scale invariance, and employs the SIVPs to determine the spatial correspondences between query image and database image. To compute the spatial correspondences efficiently, the SIVPs are introduced into the inverted index, and SIVP verification is investigated to refine the candidate images returned from inverted index. Experimental results demonstrate that our method,improves the retrieval accuracy while increasing the retrieval efficiency.

ID MODELS
AB Many deterministic small-world network models have been proposed so far, and they have been proven useful in describing some real-life networks which have fixed interconnections. Search efficiency is an important property to characterize small-world networks. This paper tries to clarify how the search procedure behaves when random walks are performed on small-world networks, including the classic WS small-world network and three deterministic small-world network models: the deterministic small-world network created by edge iterations, the tree-structured deterministic small-world network, and the small-world network derived from the deterministic uniform recursive tree. Detailed experiments are carried out to test the search efficiency of various small-world networks with regard to three different types of random walks. From the results, we conclude that the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic ones in terms of average search steps.

AB In this paper, we propose an improved face clustering method using a weighted graph-based approach. We combine two parameters as the weight of a graph to improve clustering performance. One is average similarity, which is calculated with two constraints of geometric and symmetric properties, and the other is a newly proposed parameter called the orientation matching ratio, which is calculated from orientation analysis for matched keypoints in the face region. According to the results of face clustering for several datasets, the proposed method shows improved results compared to the previous method.

AB In this paper, an energy- and traffic-balance-aware mapping algorithm from IP cores to nodes in a network is proposed for application-specific Network-on-Chip(NoC). The multi-objective optimization model is set up by considering the NoC architecture, and addressed by the proposed mapping algorithm that decomposes mapping optimization into a number of scalar subproblems simultaneously. In order to show performance of the proposed algorithm, the application specific benchmark is applied in the simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm has advantages in energy consumption and traffic balance over other algorithms.

AB Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known feature extraction method for supervised subspace learning in statistical pattern recognition. In this paper, a novel method of LDA based on a new L1-norm optimization technique and its variances are proposed. The conventional LDA, which is based on L2-norm, is sensitivity to the presence of outliers, since it used the L2-norm to measure the between-class and within-class distances. In addition, the conventional LDA often suffers from the so-called small sample size (3S) problem since the number of samples is always smaller than the dimension of the feature space in many applications, such as face recognition. Based on L1-norm, the proposed methods have several advantages, first they are robust to outliers because they utilize the L1-norm, which is less sensitive to outliers. Second, they have no 3S problem. Third, they are invariant to rotations as well. The proposed methods are capable of reducing the influence of outliers substantially, resulting in a robust classification. Performance assessment in face application shows that the proposed approaches are more effectiveness to address outliers issue than traditional ones.

TI An Efficient I/O Aggregator Assignment Scheme for Multi-Core Cluster
   Systems
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE collective I/O; parallel I/O; processor affinity
ID PERFORMANCE; DESIGN
AB As the number of nodes in high-performance computing (HPC) systems increases, parallel I/O becomes an important issue: collective I/O is the specialized parallel I/O that provides the function of single-file based parallel I/O. Collective I/O in most message passing interface (MPI) libraries follows a two-phase I/O scheme in which the particular processes, namely I/O aggregators, perform important roles by engaging the communications and I/O operations. This approach, however, is based on a single-core architecture. Because modern HPC systems use multi-core computational nodes, the roles of I/O aggregators need to be re-evaluated. Although there have been many previous studies that have focused on the improvement of the performance of collective I/O, it is difficult to locate a study regarding the assignment scheme for I/O aggregators that considers multi-core architectures. In this research, it was discovered that the communication costs in collective I/O differed according to the placement of the I/O aggregators, where each node had multiple I/O aggregators. The performance with the two processor affinity rules was measured and the results demonstrated that the distributed affinity rule used to locate the I/O aggregators in different sockets was appropriate for collective I/O. Because there may be some applications that cannot use the distributed affinity rule, the collective I/O scheme was modified in order to guarantee the appropriate placement of the I/O aggregators for the accumulated affinity rule. The performance of the proposed scheme was examined using two Linux cluster systems, and the results demonstrated that the performance improvements were more clearly evident when the computational node of a given cluster system had a complicated architecture. Under the accumulated affinity rule, the performance improvements between the proposed scheme and the original MPI-IO were up to approximately 26.25% for the read operation and up to approximately 31.27% for the write operation.

AB Automatic vessel tortuosity measures are crucial for many applications related to retinal diseases such as those due to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), hypertension, stroke, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. An automatic evaluation and quantification of retinal vascular tortuosity would help in the early detection of such retinopathies and other systemic diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel tortuosity index based on principal component analysis. The index is compared with three existant indices using simulated curves and real retinal images to demonstrate that it is a valid indicator of tortuosity. The proposed index satisfies all the tortuosity properties such as invariance to translation, rotation and scaling and also the modulation properties. It is capable of differentiating the tortuosity of structures that visually appear lobe different in tortuosity and shapes. The proposed index can automatically classify the image as tortuous or non tortuous. For an optimal set of training parameters, the prediction accuracy is as high as 82.94% and 86.6% on 45 retinal images at segment level and image level, respectively. The test results are verified against the judgement of two expert Ophthalmologists. The proposed index is marked by its inherent simplicity and computational attractiveness, and produces the expected estimate, irrespective of the segmentation approach. Examples and experimental results demonstrate the fitness and effectiveness of the proposed technique for both simulated curves and retinal images.

AB Incorporating insights from human visual perception into 3D object processing has become an important research field in computer graphics during the past decades. Many computational models for different applications have been proposed, such as mesh saliency, mesh roughness and mesh skeleton. In this letter, we present a novel Skeleton Modulated Topological Visual Perception Map (SMTPM) integrated with visual attention and visual masking mechanism. A new skeletonisation map is presented and used to modulate the weight of saliency and roughness. Inspired by salient viewpoint selection, a new Loop subdivision stencil decision based rapid viewpoint selection algorithm using our new visual perception is also proposed. Experimental results show that the SMTPM scheme can capture more richer visual perception information and our rapid viewpoint selection achieves high efficiency.

TI Sequence-Based Pronunciation Variation Modeling for Spontaneous ASR
   Using a Noisy Channel Approach
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE spontaneous speech; noisy channel approach; joint-sequence models;
   statistical machine translation
AB The performance of English automatic speech recognition systems decreases when recognizing spontaneous speech mainly due to multiple pronunciation variants in the utterances. Previous approaches address this problem by modeling the alteration of the pronunciation on a phoneme to phoneme level. However, the phonetic transformation effects induced by the pronunciation of the whole sentence have not yet been considered. In this article, the sequence-based pronunciation variation is modeled using a noisy channel approach where the spontaneous phoneme sequence is considered as a "noisy" string and the goal is to recover the "clean" string of the word sequence. Hereby, the whole word sequence and its effect on the alternation of the phonemes will be taken into consideration. Moreover, the system not only learns the phoneme transformation but also the mapping from the phoneme to the word directly. In this study, first the phonemes will be recognized with the present recognition system and afterwards the pronunciation variation model based on the noisy channel approach will map from the phoneme to the word level. Two well-known natural language processing approaches are adopted and derived from the noisy channel model theory: Joint-sequence models and statistical machine translation. Both of them are applied and various experiments are conducted using microphone and telephone of spontaneous speech.

TI A Simple and Effective Clustering Algorithm for Multispectral Images
   Using Space-Filling Curves

DT Article

AB With the wide usage of multispectral images, a fast efficient multidimensional clustering method becomes not only meaningful but also necessary. In general, to speed up the multidimensional images' analysis, a multidimensional feature vector should be transformed into a lower dimensional space. The Hilbert curve is a continuous one-to-one mapping from N-dimensional space to one-dimensional space, and can preserves neighborhood as much as possible. However, because the Hilbert curve is generated by a recurve division process, 'Boundary Effects' will happen, which means data that are close in N-dimensional space may not be close in one-dimensional Hilbert order. In this paper, a new efficient approach based on the space-filling curves is proposed for classifying multispectral satellite images. In order to remove 'Boundary Effects' of the Hilbert curve, multiple Hilbert curves, z curves, and the Pseudo-Hilbert curve are used jointly. The proposed method extracts category clusters from one-dimensional data without computing any distance in N-dimensional space. Furthermore, multispectral images can be analyzed hierarchically from coarse data distribution to fine data distribution in accordance with different application. The experimental results performed on LANDSAT data have demonstrated that the proposed method is efficient to manage the multispectral images and can be applied easily.

AB Hu, Huang and Fan proposed a fully secure hierarchical identity-based encryption (IEICE Trans. Fundamentals, Vol.E92-A, No.6, pp.1494-1499,2009) that achieves constant size of ciphertext and tight security reduction. Unfortunately, Park and Lee (IEICE Trans. Fundamentals, Vol.E93-A, No.6, pp.1269-1272,2010) found that the security proof of Hu et al.'s scheme is incorrect; that is, the security of Hu et al.'s scheme cannot be reduced to their claimed q-ABDHE assumption. However, it is unclear whether Hu et al.'s scheme is still secure. In this letter, we provide an attack to show that the scheme is not secure against the chosen-plaintext attack.

AB Acoustic data transmission is a technique which embeds data in a sound wave imperceptibly and detects it at a receiver. The data are embedded in an original audio signal and transmitted through the air by playing back the data-embedded audio using a loudspeaker. At the receiver, the data are extracted from the received audio signal captured by a microphone. In our previous work, we proposed an acoustic data transmission system designed based on phase modification of the modulated complex lapped transform (MCLT) coefficients. In this paper, we propose the spectral magnitude adjustment (SMA) technique which not only enhances the quality of the data-embedded audio signal but also improves the transmission performance of the system.

AB In this letter, a new approach to segment depth-of-field (DoF) images is proposed. The methodology is based on a two-stage model of visual neuron. The first stage is a retinal filtering by means of luminance normalizing non-linearity. The second stage is a V1-like filtering using filters estimated by independent component analysis (ICA). Segmented image is generated by the response activity of the neuron measured in terms of kurtosis. Results demonstrate that the model can discriminate image parts in different levels of depth-of-field. Comparison with other methodologies and limitations of the proposed methodology are also presented.

AB This paper presents a novel method for improving the readability of automatic speech recognition (ASR) results for classroom lectures. Because speech in a classroom is spontaneous and contains many ill-formed utterances with various disfluencies, the ASR result should be edited to improve the readability before presenting it to users, by applying some operations such as removing disfluencies, determining sentence boundaries, inserting punctuation marks and repairing dropped words. Owing to the presence of many kinds of domain-dependent words and casual styles, even state-of-the-art recognizers can only achieve a 30-50% word error rate for speech in classroom lectures. Therefore, a method for improving the readability of ASR results is needed to make it robust to recognition errors. We can use multiple hypotheses instead of the single-best hypothesis as a method to achieve a robust response to recognition errors. However, if the multiple hypotheses are represented by a lattice (or a confusion network), it is difficult to utilize sentence-level knowledge, such as chunking and dependency parsing, which are imperative for determining the discourse structure and therefore imperative for improving readability. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that infers clean, readable transcripts from spontaneous multiple hypotheses represented by a confusion network while integrating sentence-level knowledge. Automatic and manual evaluations showed that using multiple hypotheses and sentence-level knowledge is effective to improve the readability of ASR results, while preserving the understandability.

AB We present an economical and fault-tolerant load balancing strategy (EFTLBS) based on an operator replication mechanism and a load shedding method, that fully utilizes the network resources to realize continuous and highly-available data stream processing without dynamic operator migration over wide area networks. In this paper, we first design an economical operator distribution (EOD) plan based on a bin-packing model under the constraints of each stream bandwidth as well as each server's CPU capacity. Next, we devise super-operator (SO) that load balances multi-degree operator replicas. Moreover, for improving the fault-tolerance of the system, we color the SOs based on a coloring bin-packing (CBP) model that assigns peer operator replicas to different servers. To minimize the effects of input rate bursts upon the system, we take advantage of a load shedding method while keeping the QoS guarantees made by the system based on the SO scheme and the CBP model. Finally, we substantiate the utility of our work through experiments on ns-3.

DE new generation network; identity; security; privacy
AB The use of IP addresses as host IDs and locators in the present day Internet protocols imposes constraints on designing efficient solutions for mobility, multihoming, renumbering, and security. To eliminate the constraints, different approaches of introducing ID/locator split into future network architectures have been discussed recently. HIMALIS is such an architecture, which uses distinct sets of values for identifiers and locators and allows the network layer to change locators without requiring the upper layers to change identifiers. One of the major challenges of HIMALIS is the design and implementation of a distributed ID-to-locator mapping database system to efficiently store, update and provide the up-to-date mapping data to the network elements. For this purpose, this paper discusses the application of the Domain Trusted Entity (DTE) infrastructure to the HIMALIS architecture. It provides a unified manner to get locators from high level identifiers (names) with enhanced security, privacy, and trust, while maintaining all capabilities and full compatibility with the previous DNR, HNR, and IDR infrastructures found in HIMALIS.

AB Finite difference time domain (FDTD) method has been accelerated on the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell B.E.). However the problem has arisen that speedup is limited by the bandwidth of the main memory on large-scale analysis. As described in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm and implement FDTD using it. We compared the novel algorithm with results obtained using region segmentation, thereby demonstrating that the proposed algorithm has shorter calculation time than that provided by region segmentation.

TI A Graph Rewriting Approach for Converting Asynchronous ROMs into

DT Article
DE FPGA; block RAMs; asynchronous read operations; rewriting algorithm
AB Most of FPGAs have Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) to implement combinational and sequential circuits and block RAMs to implement Random Access Memories (RAMs) and Read Only Memories (ROMs). Circuit design that minimizes the number of clock cycles is easy if we use asynchronous read operations. However, most of FPGAs support synchronous read operations, but do not support asynchronous read operations. The main contribution of this paper is to provide one of the potent approaches to resolve this problem. We assume that a circuit using asynchronous ROMs designed by a non-expert or quickly designed by an expert is given. Our goal is to convert this circuit with asynchronous ROMs into an equivalent circuit with synchronous ones. The resulting circuit with synchronous ROMs can be embedded into FPGAs. We also discuss several techniques to decrease the latency and increase the clock frequency of the resulting circuits.

DE cloud computing; denial-of-quota attacks; pay-as-you-admit
AB In cloud computing, a cloud user pays proportionally to the amount of the consumed resources (bandwidth, memory, and CPU cycles etc.). We posit that such a cloud computing system is vulnerable to DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks against quota. Attackers can force a cloud user to pay more and more money by exhausting its quota without crippling its execution system or congesting links. In this paper, we address this issue and claim that cloud should enable users to pay only for their admitted traffic. We design and prototype such a charging model in a Core Lab testbed infrastructure and show an example application.

   clustering
AB Support vector clustering (SVC), a recently developed unsupervised learning algorithm, has been successfully applied to solving many real-life data clustering problems. However, its effectiveness and advantages deteriorate when it is applied to solving complex real-world problems, e.g., those with large proportion of noise data points and with connecting clusters. This paper proposes a support vector and K-Means based hybrid algorithm to improve the performance of SVC. A new SVC training method is developed based on analysis of a Gaussian kernel radius function. An empirical study is conducted to guide better selection of the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. In the proposed algorithm, firstly, the outliers which increase problem complexity are identified and removed by training a global SVC. The refined data set is then clustered by a kernel-based K-Means algorithm. Finally, several local SVCs are trained for the clusters and then each removed data point is labeled according to the distance from it to the local SVCs. Since it exploits the advantages of both SVC and K-Means, the proposed algorithm is capable of clustering compact and arbitrary organized data sets and of increasing robustness to outliers and connecting clusters. Experiments are conducted on 2-D data sets generated by mixture models and benchmark data sets taken from the UCI machine learning repository. The cluster error rate is lower than 3.0% for all the selected data sets. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm compared favorably with existing SVC algorithms.

AB Scale-invariant features are widely used for image retrieval and shape classification. The curvature of a planar curve is a fundamental feature and it is geometrically invariant with respect it the coordinate system. The curvature-based feature varies in position when multiscale analysis is performed. Therefore, it is important to recognize the scale in order to detect the feature point. Numerous shape descriptors based on contour shapes have been developed in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision. A curvature scale-space (CSS) representation cannot be applied to a contour fragment and requires the tracking of feature points. In a gradient-based curvature computation, although the gradient computation considers the scale, the curvature is normalized with respect to not the scale but the contour length. The scale-invariant feature transform algorithm that detects feature points from an image solves similar problems by using the difference of Gaussian (DoG). It is difficult to apply the SIFT algorithm to a planar curve for feature extraction. In this paper, an automatic scale detection method for a contour fragment is proposed. The proposed method detects the appropriate scales and their positions on the basis of the difference of curvature (DoC) without the tracking of feature points. To calculate the differences, scale-normalized curvature is introduced. An advantage of the DoC algorithm is that the appropriate scale can be obtained from a contour fragment as a local feature. It then extends the application area. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by experiments. The proposed method provides the most stable and robust scales of feature points among conventional methods such as curvature scale-space and gradient-based curvature.

TI Assessing the Impact of Node Churn to Random Walk-Based Overlay
   Construction
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE random walk; random scale-free overlay; node churn; decision function
AB Distributed systems desire to construct a random overlay graph for robustness, efficient information dissemination and load balancing. A random walk-based overlay construction is a promising alternative to generate an ideal random scale free overlay in distributed systems. However, a simple random walk-based overlay construction can be affected by node churn. Especially, the number of edges increases and the degree distribution is skewed. This inappropriate distortion can be exploited by malicious nodes. In this paper, we propose a modified random walk-based overlay construction supported by a logistic/trial based decision function to compensate the impact of node churn. Through event-driven simulations, we show that the decision function helps an overlay maintain the proper degree distribution, low diameter and low clustering coefficient with shorter random walks.

AB Boosting over weak classifiers is widely used in pedestrian detection. As the number of weak classifiers is large, researchers always use a sampling method over weak classifiers before training. The sampling makes the boosting process harder to reach the fixed target. In this paper, we propose a partial derivative guidance for weak classifier mining method which can be used in conjunction with a boosting algorithm. Using weak classifier mining method makes the sampling less degraded in the performance. It has the same effect as testing more weak classifiers while using acceptable time. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can process quicker than [1] algorithm in both training and testing, without any performance decrease. The proposed algorithms is easily extending to any other boosting algorithms using a window-scanning style and HOG-like features.

DE hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis; hypercomplex polar Fourier
   descriptor; rotation invariance; image representation

AB Fourier transform is a significant tool in image processing and pattern recognition. By introducing a hypercomplex number, hypercomplex Fourier transform treats a signal as a vector field and generalizes the conventional Fourier transform. Inspired from that, hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis that extends conventional polar Fourier analysis is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can handle signals represented by hypercomplex numbers as color images. The hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis is reversible that means it can be used to reconstruct image. The hypercomplex polar Fourier descriptor has rotation invariance property that can be used for feature extraction. Due to the noncommutative property of quaternion multiplication, both left-side and right-side hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis are discussed and their relationships are also established in this paper. The experimental results on image reconstruction, rotation invariance, color plate test and image retrieval are given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method as an image analysis tool.

AB Automatic recognition of finger gestures can be used for promotion of life quality. For example, a senior citizen can control the home appliance, call for help in emergency, or even communicate with others through simple finger gestures. Here, we focus on one-stroke finger gesture, which are intuitive to be remembered and performed. In this paper, we proposed and evaluated an accelerometer-based method for detecting the predefined one-stroke finger gestures from the data collected using a MEMS 3D accelerometer worn on the index finger. As alternative to the optoelectronic, sonic and ultrasonic approaches, the accelerometer-based method is featured as self-contained, cost-effective, and can be used in noisy or private space. A compact wireless sensing mote integrated with the accelerometer, called MagicRing, is developed to be worn on the finger for real data collection. A general definition on one-stroke gesture is given out, and 12 kinds of one-stroke finger gestures are selected from human daily activities. A set of features is extracted among the candidate feature set including both traditional features like standard deviation, energy, entropy, and frequency of acceleration and a new type of feature called relative feature. Both subject-independent and subject-dependent experiment methods were evaluated on three kinds of representative classifiers. In the subject-independent experiment among 20 subjects, the decision tree classifier shows the best performance recognizing the finger gestures with an average accuracy rate for 86.92 %. In the subject-dependent experiment, the nearest neighbor classifier got the highest accuracy rate for 97.55 %.

DE QoS; probabilistic automaton; simulation; model checking
AB For the Internet, system developers often have to estimate the QoS by simulation techniques or mathematical analysis. Probabilistic model checking can evaluate performance, dependability and stability of information processing systems with random behaviors. We apply a hybrid analysis approach onto real-time distributed systems. In the hybrid analysis approach, we perform stepwise analysis using probabilistic models of target systems in different abstract levels. First, we create a probabilistic model with detailed behavior of the system (called detailed model), and apply simulation on the detailed model. Next, based on the simulation results, we create a probabilistic model in an abstract level (called simplified model). Then, we verify qualitative properties using the probabilistic model checking techniques. This prevents from state-explosion. We evaluate the validity of our approach by comparing to simulation results of NS-2 using a case study of a video data streaming system. The experiments show that the result of the proposed approach is very close to that of NS-2 simulation. The result encourages the approach is useful for the performance analysis on various domain.

DE MH3DT network; deadlock-free routing; non-uniform traffic; Inter-node
   communication performance
AB A Modified Hierarchical 3D-Torus (MH3DT) network is a 3D-torus network consisting of multiple basic modules, in which each basic module itself is a 3D-torus network. Inter-node communication performance has been evaluated using dimension-order routing and 2 virtual channels (VCs) under uniform traffic patterns but not under non-uniform traffic patterns. In this paper, we evaluate the inter-node communication performance of MH3DT under five non-uniform traffic patterns and compare it with other networks. We found that under non-uniform traffic patterns, the MH3DT yields high throughput and low latency, providing better inter-node communication performance compared to H3DT, TESH, mesh, and torus networks. Also, we found that non-uniform traffic patterns have higher throughput than uniform traffic in the MH3DT network.

DE Hessian matrix; interest point detector; image matching
AB An advanced interest point detector is proposed to improve the Hessian-Matrix based detector of the SURF algorithm. Round-like shapes are utilized as the filter shape to calculate of the Hessian determinant. D-xy can be acquired from approximate round areas, while the regions for computing D-yy or D-xx are designed with the consideration to symmetry and a balance of pixel number. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has higher repeatability than the one used in SURF, especially in the aspects of rotation and viewpoint, due to the centrosymmetry of the proposed filter shapes. The results of image matching also show that more ?recision can be gained with the application of proposed detector.

AB The Network-on-Chip (NoC) is limited by the reliability constraint, which impels us to exploit the fault-tolerant routing. Generally, there are two main design objectives: tolerating more faults and achieving high network performance. To this end, we propose a new multiple-round dimension-order routing (NMR-DOR). Unlike existing solutions, besides the intermediate nodes inter virtual channels (VCs), some turn-legally intermediate nodes inside each VC are also utilized. Hence, more faults are tolerated by those new introduced intermediate nodes without adding extra VCs. Furthermore, unlike the previous solutions where some VCs are prioritized, the NMR-DOR provides a more flexible manner to evenly distribute packets among different VCs. With extensive simulations, we prove that the NMR-DOR maximally saves more than 90% unreachable node pairs blocked by faults in previous solutions, and significantly reduces the packet latency compared with existing solutions.

TI Checking Behavioral Compatibility between Objects by Extending the

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE object oriented programming
ID SUBTYPING RELATIONS; SPECIFICATION
AB Behavioral compatibility between subtypes and supertypes in object-oriented systems is a very important issue to enable the substitution between object types since it supports the extension and evolution of an object oriented system. In other words, the subtype must be guaranteed that it can provide all behaviors (operations) of the supertype for replacing the supertype with the subtype. Invocation consistency checking is one of techniques to verify behavioral compatibility between two object types. The technique confirms weather an object type can accept all sequence of operations of the other object type or not. The classical methods rule checks behavioral compatibility by verifying invocation consistency of two object types. The rule argues that subtypes meet behavioral compatibility with supertypes if the subtypes' preconditions of inherited operations are weakened and postconditions are strengthened. Noting that the classical methods rule is not sufficient for checking behavioral compatibility between objects, we propose an extended methods rule on the basis of the classical methods rule. Based on the proposed extended methods rule, we have implemented a tool, BCCT, to automatically check behavioral compatibility between two objects.

AB The performance of the kernel based learning algorithms such as SVM depends heavily on the proper choice of the kernel parameter It is desirable for the kernel machines to work on the optimal kernel parameter that adapts well to the input data and the learning tasks In this paper we present a novel method for selecting Gaussian kernel parameter by maximizing a class separability criterion which measures the data distribution in the kernel induced feature space and is invariant under any non singular linear transformation The experimental results show that both the class separability of the data in the kernel induced feature space and the classification performance of the SVM classifier are improved by using the optimal kernel parameter

AB In 2006 Yeh and Tsai proposed a mobile commerce security mechanism However in 2008 Yum et al pointed out that Yeh Tsai security mechanism is not secure against malicious WAP gateways and then proposed a simple countermeasure against the attack is to use a cryptographic hash function instead of the addition operation Nevertheless this paper shows that both Yeh Tsai s and Yum et al s security mechanisms still do not provide perfect forward secrecy and are susceptible to an off line guessing attack and Denning Sacco attack In addition we propose a new security mechanism to overcome the weaknesses of the previous related security mechanisms

ID HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION
AB Various contrast enhancement methods such as histogram equalization (HE) and local contrast enhancement (LCE) have been developed to increase the visibility and details of a degraded image. We propose an image contrast enhancement method based on the global and local adjustment of gray levels by combining HE with LCE methods. For the optimal combination of both, we introduce a discrete entropy. Evaluation of our experimental results shows that the proposed method outperforms both the HE and LCE methods.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents an efficient instruction scheduling algorithm which generates low-power codes for embedded system applications. Reordering and recoding are concurrently applied for low-power code generation in the proposed algorithm. By appropriate reordering of instruction sequences, the efficiency of instruction recoding is increased. The proposed algorithm constructs program codes on a basic-block basis by selecting a code sequence from among the schedules generated randomly and maintained by the system. By generating random schedules for each of the basic blocks constituting an application program, the proposed algorithm constructs a histogram graph for each of the instruction fields to estimate the figure-of-merits achievable by reordering instruction sequences. For further optimization, the system performs simulated annealing on the generated code. Experimental results for benchmark programs show that the codes generated by the proposed algorithm consume 37.2% less power on average when compared to the previous algorithm which performs list scheduling prior to instruction recoding.

AB Deploying and managing content objects efficiently is critical for building a scalable and transparent content delivery system. This paper investigates the advanced incremental deploying problem of which the objects are delivered in a successive manner. Recently, the researchers show that the minimum-cost content deployment can be obtained by reducing the problem to the well-known network flow problem. In this paper, the maximum flow algorithm for a single graph is extended to the incremental growing graph. Based on this extension, an efficient incremental content deployment algorithm is developed in this work.

TI Execution Assurance for Massive Computing Tasks

AB Consider a client who intends to perform a massive computing task comprsing a number of sub-tasks, while both storage and computation are outsourced by a third-party service provider. How could the client ensure the integrity and completeness of the computation result? Meanwhile, how could the assurance mechanism incur no disincentive, e.g., excessive communication cost, for any service provider or client to participate in such a scheme? We detail this problem and present a general model of execution assurance for massive computing tasks. A series of key features distinguish our work from existing ones: a) we consider the context wherein both storage and computation are provided by untrusted third parties, and client has no data possession; b) we propose a simple yet effective assurance model based on a novel integration of the machineries of data authentication and computational private information retrieval (cPIR); c) we conduct an analytical study on the inherent trade-offs among the verification accuracy, and the computation, storage, and communication costs.

TI A Secure and Scalable Rekeying Mechanism for Hierarchical Wireless
   Sensor Networks
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE key management; group rekeying; hierarchical wireless sensor network;
   security
AB Many applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require secure group communications. The WSNs are normally operated in unattended, harsh, or hostile environment. The adversaries may easily compromise some sensor nodes and abuse their shared keys to inject false sensing reports or modify the reports sent by other nodes. Once a malicious node is detected, the group key should be renewed immediately for the network security. Some strategies have been proposed to develop the group rekeying protocol. but most of existing schemes are not suitable for sensor networks due to their high overhead and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a new group rekeying protocol for hierarchical WSNs with renewable network devices. Compared with existing schemes, our rekeying method possesses the following features that are particularly beneficial to the resource-constrained large-scale WSNs: (I) robustness to the node capture attack. (2) reactive rekeying capability to malicious nodes, and (3) low communication and storage overhead.

AB This letter proposes a method to retrieve the original image X out of multiple sets of SI (Side Information) in distributed video coding (DVC). Using Turbo decoding methods, the most reliable segments from the decoded Y-i's were selected for the composition of whose conditional entropy H(X vertical bar Y-infinity) became much lower than any individual conditional entropy H(X vertical bar Y-i). This proposal has improved the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 1.1 to 1.8 dB, compared to the conventional single SI-based approach.

AB To detect the natural clusters for irregularly shaped data distribution is a difficult task in pattern recognition. In this study, we propose an efficient clustering algorithm for irregularly shaped clusters based on the advantages of spectral clustering and Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm. We give a new similarity measure based on neighborhood dispersion analysis. The proposed algorithm is a simple but effective method. The experimental results on several data sets show that the algorithm can detect the natural clusters of input data sets, and the clustering results agree well with that of human judgment.

AB This paper describes an incremental parser based on an adjoining operation. By using the operation, we can avoid the problem of infinite local ambiguity. This paper further proposes a restricted version of the adjoining operation, which preserves lexical dependencies of partial parse trees. Our experimental results showed that the restriction enhances the accuracy of the incremental parsing.

ID DESIGN
AB In the recent high-density and low-power VLSIs, the occurrence of soft errors has become a significant problem. Recently, soft errors frequently occur on not only memory system but also logic circuits. Based on this standpoint, some constructions of soft-error-tolerant FFs were proposed. A conventional FF consists of some master and slave latches and C-elements. In the FF, soft error pulses occurring on combinational parts of logic circuits are corrected as long as the width of the pulses is narrow, that is within a specified width. However, error pulses with wide width are neither detected nor corrected in the FF. This paper presents a construction of soft-error-tolerant FFs by modifying the conventional soft-error-tolerant FF. The proposed FFs have the capability to detect error pulses having wide width as well as the capability to correct those having narrow width. The proposed FFs are also capable of detecting hard errors. The evaluation shows the soft-error-tolerant capability, AC characteristics, area overhead and power consumption of the FFs.

AB This paper presents An efficient algorithm for large-scale multi-system learning task. The proposed architecture. referred to as the 'RBFxSOM'. is based on the SOM(2), that is, a 'SOM of SOMs'. As is the case in the modular network SOM (mnSOM) with multilayer perceptron modules (MLP-mnSOM), the aim of the RBFxSOM is to organize a continuous map of nonlinear functions representing multi-class input-output relations of the given datasets. By adopting the algorithm for the SOM2. the RBFxSOM generates a map much faster than the original mnSOM, and without the local minima problem. In addition, the RBFxSOM can be applied to more difficult Cases, that were not easily dealt with by the MLP-mnSOM. Thus. the RBFxSOM can deal with cases in which the probability density of the inputs is dependent on the classes. This tends to happen more often as the input dimension increases. The RBFxSOM therefore, overcomes many of the problems inherent in the MLP-mnSOM, and this is crucial for application to large scale tasks. Simulation results with artificial datasets and a meteorological dataset confirm the performance of the RBFxSOM.

AB A data stream is a series of massive unbounded tuples continuously generated at a rapid rate. Continuous queries for data streams should be processed continuously. so that it strict time constraint is required. In most previous research studies, in order to guarantee this constraint, the evaluation order of join predicates ill a continuous query is optimized Using a greed), strategy. However, because a greedy strategy traces only the first promising plan, it often finds a suboptimal plan. To reduce the possibility of producing a suboptimal plan. in this paper, we propose an improved scheme, k-Extended Greedy Algorithm (k-EGA). that simultaneously examines a set of promising plans and reoptimize an execution plan adaptively. The number of promising plans is flexibly controlled by a user-defined range variable. The scheme verifies the performance of the Current plan periodically. If the plan is no longer efficient, a newly optimized plan is generated. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified through various experiments to identify its various characteristics.

AB This paper proposes a novel service configuration approach that can realize dynamic critical Quality of Service (QoS) adaptation to ever-changing and resource-limited ubiquitous computing environments. In the approach, service configuration is reduced to a Fuzzy Control System (FCS) which aims to achieve critical QoS variations on minimal level with less power cost. Two configuration strategies, service chain re-configuration and QoS parameters adjustment, along with a configuration algorithm, are implemented to handle different types of QoS variations. A self-optimizing algorithm is designed to enhance the adaptation of the FCS. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.

AB Salient Region Extraction provides an alternative methodology to image description in many applications such as adaptive content delivery and image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a robust approach to extracting the salient region based on bottom-up visual attention. The main contributions are twofold: 1) Instead of the feature parallel integration, the proposed saliencies are derived by serial processing between texture and color features. Hence, the proposed approach intrinsically provides an alternative methodology to model attention with low implementation complexity. 2) A constructive approach is proposed for rendering an image by a non-linear intensity mapping, which can efficiently eliminate high contrast noise regions in the image. And then the salient map can be robustly generated for a variety of nature images. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can characterize the human perception well.

DE acoustic field representation; blind source separation; frequency-domain
   independent component analysis (FD-ICA); spatial grouping
AB A sound field reproduction method is proposed that uses blind source separation and a head-related transfer function. In the proposed system, multichannel acoustic signals Captured at distant microphones are decomposed to a set of location/signal pairs of virtual sound sources based on frequency-domain independent component analysis, After estimating the locations and the signals of the virtual sources by convolving the controlled acoustic transfer functions with cacti signal, the spatial Sound is constructed at the selected point. In experiments. a sound field made by six Sound sources is Captured using 48 distant microphones and decomposed into sets of, virtual sound sources. Since Subjective evaluation shows no significant difference between natural and reconstructed Sound when Six Virtual sources and are used. the effectiveness of the decomposing algorithm as Well as the virtual source representation are confirmed.

TI DTW-Distance Based Kernel for Time Series Data
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE DTW; SDP; SVM
AB One of the advantages of the kernel methods is that they can deal with various kinds of objects, not necessarily vectorial data with a fixed number of attributes. In this paper, we develop kernels for time series data using dynamic time warping (DTW) distances. Since DTW distances are pseudo distances that do not satisfy the triangle inequality, a kernel matrix based on them is not positive semidefinite, in general. We use semidefinite programming (SDP) to guarantee the positive definiteness of a kernel matrix. We present neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE), an SDP formulation to obtain a kernel matrix that best preserves the local geometry of time series data. We also present an out-of-sample extension (OSE) for NPE. We use two applications, time series classification and time series embedding for similarity search, to validate our approach.

AB In recent years. heterogeneous devices have been employed frequently in mobile storage systems because a combination of such devices can supply it synergistically useful storage solution by taking advantage of each device, One important design constraint in heterogeneous storage systems is to mitigate I/O performance degradation stemming from the difference between access times of different devices. To this end. there has not been much work to devise proper buffer cache management algorithms. This paper presents it novel huller cache management algorithm which considers both I/O cost per device and workload patterns in mobile computing systems with it heterogeneous storage pair of a hard disk all a NAND flash memory. In order to minimize the total I/O cost under varying workload patterns, the proposed algorithm employs a dynamic cache partitioning technique over different devices and manages each partition according to request patterns and I/O types along with the temporal locality. Trace-based Simulations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the total I/O cost and flash write count significantly over the existing buffer cache algorithms on typical mobile traces.

AB In this letter, we propose a cache organization that substantially reduces the memory bandwidth of motion compensation (MC) in the H.264/AVC decoders. To reduce duplicated memory accesses to P and B pictures, we employ a four-way set-associative cache in which its index bits are composed of horizontal and vertical address bits of the Frame buffer and each line stores in 8 x 2 pixel data in the reference frames. Moreover, we alleviate the data fragmentation problem by selecting its line size that equals the minimum access size of the DDR SDRAM. The bandwidth of the optimized cache averaged over five QCIF IBBP image sequences requires only 129% of the essential bandwidth of an H.264/AVC MC.

TI Novel Topic Maps to RDF/RDF Schema Translation Method
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Topic Maps; RDF; Semantic Web; Web ontology; Web metadata
AB We propose an enhanced method for translating Topic Maps to RDF/RDF Schema, to realize the Semantic Web. A critical issue for the Semantic Web is to efficiently and precisely describe Web information resources, i.e., Web metadata. Two representative standards, Topic Maps and RDF have been used for Web metadata. RDF-based standardization and implementation of the Semantic Web have been actively performed. Since the Semantic Web must accept and understand all Web information resources that are represented with the other methods, Topic Maps-to-RDF translation has become an issue. Even though many Topic Maps to RDF translation methods have been devised, they still have several problems (e.g. semantic loss, complex expression, etc.). Our translation method provides an improved solution to these problems. This method shows lower semantic loss than the previous methods due to extract both explicit semantics and implicit semantics. Compared to the previous methods, our method reduces the encoding complexity of resulting RDF. In addition, in terms of reversibility, the proposed method regenerates all Topic Maps constructs in an original source when is reverse translated.

AB This paper investigates the problem of nonpreemptively scheduling independent parallel tasks in an environment with Multiple machines. which is motivated front the recent studies in scheduling tasks in a multi-machine environment. fit this scheduling environment, each machine contains a number of identical processors and each parallel task can simultaneously require a number of processors for its processing in any single machine. Whenever tasks are processed in parallel in a parallel machine, message communication among processors is often inevitable. The problem of finding a shortest schedule length on scheduling independent parallel tasks with the consideration of communication overhead in a multi-machine environment is NP-hard. The aim of this paper is to propose a heuristic algorithm for this kind of problem and to analyze the performance bound of this heuristic algorithm.

AB Service robots need to be able to recognize and identify objects located within complex backgrounds. Since no single method may work in every situation, several methods need to be combined and robots have to select the appropriate one automatically. In this paper we propose a scheme to classify situations depending on the characteristics of the object of interest and user demand. We classify situations into four groups and employ different techniques for each. We use Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) in conjunction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) using intensity, color, and Gabor features for five object categories. We show that the use of appropriate features is important for the use of KPCA and SVM based techniques on different kinds of objects. Through experiments we show that by using our categorization scheme a service robot can select an appropriate feature and method, and considerably improve its recognition performance. Yet, recognition is not perfect. Thus, we propose to combine the autonomous method with an interactive method that allows the robot to recognize the user request for a specific object and class when the robot fails to recognize the object. We also propose an interactive way to update the object model that is used to recognize an object upon failure in conjunction with the user's feedback.

AB We examined how spatial disparity between the auditory and visual stimuli modulated the audio-visual (A-V) prior entry effect. Spatial and temporal proximity of multisensory stimuli are crucial factors for multisensory perception in most cases (e.g. [1], [2]). However our previous research [3], [4] suggested that this well-accepted hypothesis was not applicable to the AN prior entry effect. In order to examine the effect of the spatial disparity on the AN prior entry effect, six loudspeakers and two light emitting diodes (LEDs) were used as stimuli. The loudspeakers were located at 10, 25, and 90 degrees from the midline of the participants to both right and left sides. A preceding sound was presented from one of these six loudspeakers. After the preceding sound, two visual targets were presented successively at a short interval and participants judged which visual target was presented first. Two colour changeable ('red' or 'green') LEDs were used for the visual targets and participants judged the order of visual targets by their colour not by their side in order to avoid the response bias as much as possible. The visual targets were situated at 10 degrees or 25 degrees from the participants' midline to both right and left in the Experiment 1. Results showed a biased judgment that the visual target at the sound presented side was presented first. The amplitude of the AN prior entry effect was greater when the preceding sound source was more apart from the midline of participants. This effect of spatial separation indicated that the clarity of either right or left side of the preceding sound enhanced the amplitude of the AN prior entry effect (Experiment 2). These results challenge the belief that the spatial proximity of multisensory stimuli is a crucial factor for multisensory perception.

AB A deterministic pushdown automaton (dpda) having just one stack symbol is called a deterministic restricted one-counter automaton (droca). When it accepts an input by empty stack, it is called strict. This paper is concerned with a subclass of real-time strict droca's, called Szilard strict droca's, and studies the problem of identifying the subclass in the limit from positive data. The class of languages accepted by Szilard strict droca's coincides with the class of Szilard languages (or, associated languages) of strict droca's and is incomparable to each of the class of regular languages and that of simple languages. After providing some properties of languages accepted by Szilard strict droca's, we show that the class of Szilard strict droca's is polynomial time identifiable in the limit from positive data in the sense of Yokomori. This identifiability is proved by giving an exact characteristic sample of polynomial size for a language accepted by a Szilard strict droca. The class of very simple languages, which is a proper subclass of simple languages, is also proved to be polynomial time identifiable in the limit from positive data by Yokomori, but it is yet unknown whether there exists a characteristic sample of polynomial size for any very simple language.

AB The management of subscriptions and events is an important task in the content-based publish/subscribe system. A good management mechanism can not only produce lower matching costs to speed up the delivery of matched events to the interested subscribers but can also induce good load balancing for subscription storage. In this paper, we consider the construction of this kind of system over a peer-to-peer overlay network and propose two message-to-node mapping schemes for system management. We both analyze and simulate the performance of the proposed schemes. The simulation results show the superiority of our schemes over existing ones.

TI Adaptive Bloom Filter: A space-efficient counting algorithm for

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE Bloom Filter; counting; burst traffic
AB The Bloom Filter (BF), a space-and-time-efficient hash-coding method, is used as one of the fundamental modules in several network processing algorithms and applications such as route lookups, cache hits, packet classification, per-flow state management or network monitoring. BF is a simple space-efficient randomized data structure used to represent a data set in order to support membership queries. However, BF generates false positives, and cannot count the number of distinct elements. A counting Bloom Filter (CBF) can count the number of distinct elements, but CBF needs more space than BF. We propose an alternative data structure of CBF, and we called this structure an Adaptive Bloom Filter (ABF). Although ABF uses the same-sized bit-vector used in BF, the number of hash functions employed by ABF is dynamically changed to record the number of appearances of a each key element. Considering the hash collisions, the multiplicity of a each key element on ABF can be estimated from the number of hash functions used to decode the membership of the each key element. Although ABF can realize the same functionality as CBF, ABF requires the same memory size as BF. We describe the construction of ABF and IABF (Improved ABF), and provide a mathematical analysis and simulation using Zipf's distribution. Finally, we show that ABF can be used for an unpredictable data set such as real network traffic.

AB The RSA-based Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols have been proposed to realize both mutual authentication and generation of secure session keys where a client is sharing his/her password only with a server and the latter should generate its RSA public/private key pair (e, n), (d, n) every time due to the lack of PKI (Public-Key Infrastructures). One of the ways to avoid a special kind of off-line (so called e-residue) attacks in the RSA-based PAKE protocols is to deploy a challenge/response method by which a client verifies the relative primality of e and phi(n) interactively with a server. However, this kind of RSA-based PAKE protocols did not give any proof of the underlying challenge/response method and therefore could not specify the exact complexity of their protocols since there exists another security parameter, needed in the challenge/response method. In this paper, we first present an RSA-based PAKE (RSA-PAKE) protocol that can deploy two different challenge/response methods (denoted by Challenge/Response Method1 and Challenge/Response Method2). The main contributions of this work include: (1) Based on the number theory, we prove that the Challenge/Response Method1 and the Challenge/Response Method2 are secure against e-residue attacks for any odd prime e; (2) With the security parameter for the on-line attacks, we show that the RSA-PAKE protocol is provably secure in the random oracle model where all of the off-line attacks are not more efficient than on-line dictionary attacks; and (3) By considering the Hamming weight of e and its complexity in the RSA-PAKE protocol, we search for primes to be recommended for a practical use. We also compare the RSA-PAKE protocol with the previous ones mainly in terms of computation and communication complexities.

AB We present a method to identify stakeholders and their preferences about non-functional requirements (NFR) by using use case diagrams of existing systems. We focus on the changes about NFR because such changes help stakeholders to identify their preferences. Comparing different use case diagrams of the same domain helps us to find changes to be occurred. We utilize Goal-Question-Metrics (GQM) method for identifying variables that characterize NFR, and we can systematically represent changes about NFR using the variables. Use cases that represent system interactions help us to bridge the gap between goals and metrics (variables), and we can easily construct measurable NFR. For validating and evaluating our method, we applied our method to an application domain of Mail User Agent (MUA) system.

TI A checkpointing method with small checkpoint latency
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE dependability; checkpointing; checkpoint overhead; checkpoint latency;

AB The cost of checkpointing consists of checkpoint overhead and checkpoint latency. The former is the time to stop the process for checkpointing. The latter is the time to complete the checkpointing including background checkpointing which stores memory pages. The large checkpoint latency increases the possibility that the error occurs in background checkpointing, which leads to long rollback distance. The method for small checkpoint latency has not been proposed yet. This paper proposes a checkpointing method which achieves small checkpoint latency. The proposed method divides a checkpoint interval into several sub-checkpoint intervals. By using the history of memory page modification in sub-checkpoint intervals, the proposed method saves some pages which are not expected to be modified in the rest of checkpoint interval in advance. Computer simulation says that the proposed method can reduce the checkpoint latency by 25% comparing to the existing methods.

DE edge detection; intra-prediction; H.264/AVC
AB In this paper, a fast mode decision method for intra-prediction is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of H.264/AVC encoders. With edge information, we propose a novel fast estimation algorithm to reduce the computation overhead of H.264/AVC for mode selection, where the edge direction of each coding block is detected from only part of the transformed coefficients. Hence, the computation complexity is greatly reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed fast mode decision method can eliminate about 81.34% encoding time for all intra-frame sequences with acceptable degradation of averaged PSNR and bitrates.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The rapid advancement of VLSI technology has made it possible for chip designers and manufacturers to embed the components of a whole system onto a single chip, called System-on-Chip or SoC. SoCs make use of pre-designed modules, called IP-cores, which provide faster design time and quicker time-to-market. Furthermore, SoCs that operate at multiple clock domains and very low power requirements are being utilized in the latest communications, networking and signal processing devices. As a result, the testing of SoCs and multi-clock domain embedded cores under power constraints has been rapidly gaining importance. In this research, a novel method for designing power-aware test wrappers for embedded cores with multiple clock domains is presented. By effectively partitioning the various clock domains, we are able to increase the solution space of possible test schedules for the core. Since previous methods were limited to concurrently testing all the clock domains, we effectively remove this limitation by making use of bandwidth conversion, multiple shift frequencies and properly gating the clock signals to control the shift activity of various core logic elements. The combination of the above. techniques gains us greater flexibility when determining an optimal test schedule under very tight power constraints. Furthermore, since it is computationally intensive to search the entire expanded solution space for the possible test schedules, we propose a heuristic 3-D bin packing algorithm to determine the optimal wrapper architecture and test schedule while minimizing the test time under power and bandwidth constraints.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE item pricing; approximation algorithm; pseudodegree; valuation ratio
AB When a store sells items to customers, the store wishes to decide the prices of the items to maximize its profit. If the store sells the items with low (resp. high) prices, the customers buy more (resp. less) items, which provides less profit to the store. It would be hard for the store to decide the prices of items. Assume that a store has a set V of n items and there is a set C of m customers who wish to buy those items. The goal of the store is to decide the price of each item to maximize its profit. We refer to this maximization problem as an item pricing problem. We classify the item pricing problems according to how many items the store can sell or how the customers valuate the items. If the store can sell every item i with unlimited (resp. limited) amount, we refer to this as unlimited supply (resp. limited supply). We say that the item pricing problem is single-minded if each customer j is an element of C wishes to buy a set e(j) subset of V of items and assigns valuation w(e(j)) >= 0. For the single-minded item pricing problems (in unlimited supply), Bal-can and Blum regarded them as weighted k-hypergraphs and gave several approximation algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the (pseudo) degree of k-hypergraphs and the valuation ratio, i.e., the ratio between the smallest and the largest valuations. Then for the single-minded item pricing problems (in unlimited supply), we show improved approximation algorithms (for k-hypergraphs, general graphs, bipartite graphs, etc.) with respect to the maximum (pseudo) degree and the valuation ratio.

TI TCP reassembler for layer7-aware network intrusion detection/prevention

   layer7-aware NIDS/NIPS; TCP reassembler
AB Exploiting layer7 context is an effective approach to improving the accuracy of detecting malicious messages in network intrusion detection/prevention systems (NIDS/NIPSs). Layer7 context enables us to inspect message formats and the message exchanged order. Unfortunately, layer7-aware NIDS/NIPSs pose crucial implementation issues because they require full TCP and IP reassembly without losing 1) complete prevention, 2) performance, 3) application transparency, or 4) transport transparency. Complete prevention means that the NIDS/NIPS should prevent malicious messages from reaching target applications. Application transparency means not requiring any modifications to and/or reconfiguration of server and client applications. Transport transparency is not to disrupt the end-to-end semantics of TCP/IP. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches meet all of these requirements. We have developed an efficient mechanism for layer7-aware NIDS/NIPSs that does meet the above requirements. Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying the packet even if it has not been checked yet by an NIDS/NIPS sensor. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack message, the store-through mechanism can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets that contain another part of attack message. Testing of a prototype in Linux kernel 2.4.30 demonstrated that the overhead of our mechanism is negligible compared with that of a simple IP forwarder even with the presence of out-of-order and IP-fragmented packets. In addition, the experimental results suggest that the CPU and memory usage incurred by our store-through is not significant.

TI Simple weighting techniques for query expansion in biomedical document
   retrieval
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE query expansion; biomedical terminology; biomedical document retrieval;
   biomedical terminology weighting
AB In this paper, we propose two weighting techniques to improve performances of query expansion in biomedical document retrieval, especially when a short biomedical term in a query is expanded with its synonymous multi-word terms. When a query contains synonymous terms of different lengths, a traditional IR model highly ranks a document containing a longer terminology because a longer terminology has more chance to be matched with a query. However, such preference is clearly inappropriate and it often yields an unsatisfactory result. To alleviate the bias weighting problem, we devise a method of normalizing the weights of query terms in a long multi-word biomedical term, an a method of discriminating terms by using inverse terminology frequency which is a novel statistics estimated in a query domain. The experiment results on MEDLINE corpus show that our two simple techniques improve the retrieval performance by adjusting the inadequate preference for long multi-word terminologies in an expanded query.

DE elementary discourse unit (EDU); multiple EDU causality extraction;
   causative antecedent; effective consequence; causality boundary
   identification; verb-pair rules extraction
AB This research aims to develop automatic knowledge mining of causality from texts for supporting an automatic question answering system (QA) in answering 'why' question, which is among the most crucial forms of questions. The out come of this research will assist people in diagnosing problems, such as in plant diseases, health, industrial and etc. While the previous works have extracted causality knowledge within only one or two adjacent EDUs (Elementary Discourse Units), this research focuses to mine causality knowledge existing within multiple EDUs which takes multiple causes and multiple effects in to consideration, where the adjacency between cause and effect is unnecessary. There are two main problems: how to identify the interesting causality events from documents, and how to identify the boundaries of the causative unit and the effective unit in term of the multiple EDUs. In addition, there are at least three main problems involved in boundaries identification: the implicit boundary de-limiter, the nonadjacent cause-consequence, and the effect surrounded by causes. This research proposes using verb-pair rules learnt by comparing the Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify causality EDUs in Thai agricultural and health news domains. The boundary identification problems are solved by utilizing verb-pair rules, Centering Theory and cue phrase set. The reason for emphasizing on using verbs to extract causality is that they explicitly make, in a certain way, the consequent events of cause-effect, e.g. 'Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves. Then leaves will shrink. Later, they will become yellow and dry.'. The outcome of the proposed methodology shown that the verb-pair rules extracted from NB outperform those extracted from SVM when the corpus contains high occurence of each verb, while the results from SVM is better than NB when the corpus contains less occurence of each verb. The verb-pair rules extracted from NB for causality extraction has the highest precision (0.88) with the recall of 0.75 from the plant disease corpus whereas from SVM has the highest precision (0.89) with the recall of 0.76 from bird flu news. For boundary determination, our methodology can handle very well with approximate 96% accuracy. In addition, the extracted causality results from this research can be generalized as laws in the Inductive-Statistical theory of Hempel's explanation theory, which will be useful for QA and reasoning.

AB Machine learning techniques have long been applied in many fields and have gained a lot of success. The purpose of learning processes is generally to obtain a set of parameters based on a given data set by minimizing a certain objective function which can explain the data set in a maximum likelihood or minimum estimation error sense. However, most of the learned parameters are highly data dependent and rarely reflect the true physical mechanism that is involved in the observation data. In order to obtain the inherent knowledge involved in the observed data, it is necessary to combine physical models with learning process rather than only fitting the observations with a black box model. To reveal underlying properties of human speech production. we proposed a learning process based on a physiological articulatory model and a coarticulation model, where both of the models are derived from human mechanisms. A two-layer learning framework was designed to learn the parameters concerned with physiological level using the physiological articulatory model and the parameters in the motor planning level using the coarticulation model. The learning process was carried out on an articulatory database of human speech production. The learned parameters were evaluated by numerical experiments and listening tests. The phonetic targets obtained in the planning stage provided an evidence for understanding the virtual targets of human speech production. As a result, the model based learning process reveals the inherent mechanism of the human speech via the learned parameters with certain physical meaning.

AB Owing to the large amount of speckle noise and ill-defined edges present in echocardiographic images, computer-based boundary detection of the left ventricle has proved to be a challenging problem. In this paper, a Markovian level set method for boundary detection in long-axis echocardiographic images is proposed. It combines Markov random field (MRF) model, which makes use of local statistics with level set method that handles topological changes, to detect a continuous and smooth boundary. Experimental results show that higher accuracy can be achieved with the proposed method compared with two related MRF-based methods.

TI Data hiding in binary images with distortion-minimizing capabilities by
   optimal block pattern coding and dynamic programming techniques
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE data hiding; binary image; block pattern encoding; dynamic programming;
   image distortion minimization
AB A new method for data hiding in binary images based on block pattern coding and dynamic programming with distortion-minimizing capabilities is proposed. Up to three message data bits can be embedded into each 2 x 2 block in an input image by changing the block's pixel pattern into another, which represents the value of the message data bits as a code according to a block pattern encoding table. And extraction of hidden message data is accomplished by block pattern decoding. To minimize the resulting image distortion, two optimization techniques are proposed. The first is to use multiple block pattern encoding tables, from which an optimal one is selected specifically for each input image, and the second is to use a dynamic programming algorithm to divide the message data into bit segments for optimal embedding in a sense of minimizing the number of binary bit flippings. Accordingly, not only more data bits can be embedded in an image block on the average, but the resulting image distortion is also reduced in an optimal way. Experimental results are also included to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Feature selection in genetic fuzzy discretization for the pattern
   classification problems
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE genetic algorithm; fuzzy discretization; feature selection; pattern
   classification
AB We propose a new genetic fuzzy discretization method with feature selection for the pattern classification problems. Traditional discretization methods categorize a continuous attribute into a number of bins. Because they are made on crisp discretization, there exists considerable information loss. Fuzzy discretization allows overlapping intervals and reflects linguistic classification. However, the number of intervals, the boundaries of intervals, and the degrees of overlapping are intractable to get optimized and a discretization process increases the total amount of data being transformed. We use a genetic algorithm with feature selection not only to optimize these parameters but also to reduce the amount of transformed data by filtering the unconcerned attributes. Experimental results showed considerable improvement on the classification accuracy over a crisp discretization and a typical fuzzy discretization with feature selection.

AB Recently, research on parallel processing systems is very active, and many complex topologies have been proposed. A burnt pancake graph is one such topology. In this paper, we prove that a faulty burnt pancake graph with degree n has a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle if the number of the faulty elements is n-2 or less, and it has a fault-free Hamiltonian path between any pair of nonfaulty nodes if the number of the faulty elements is n - 3 or less.

AB The model selection for neural networks is an essential procedure to get not only high levels of generalization but also a compact data model. Especially in terms of getting the compact model, neural networks usually outperform other kinds of machine learning methods. Generally, models are selected by trial and error testing using whole learning samples given in advance. In many cases, however, it is difficult and time consuming to prepare whole learning samples in advance. To overcome these inconveniences, we propose a hybrid on-line learning system for a radial basis function (RBF) network that repeats quick learning of novel instances by rote during on-line periods (awake phases) and repeats pseudo rehearsal for model selection during out-of-service periods (sleep phases). We call this system Incremental Learning with Sleep (ILS). During sleep phases, the system basically stops the learning of novel instances, and during awake phases, the system responds quickly. We also extended the system so as to shorten the periodic sleep periods. Experimental results showed the system selects more compact data models than those selected by other machine learning systems.

ID TEST DATA-COMPRESSION
AB A tri-template-based codes (TTBC) method is proposed to reduce test cost of intellectual property (IP) cores. In order to reduce test data volume (TDV), the approach utilizes three templates, i.e., all 0, all 1, and the previously applied test data, for generating the subsequent test data by flipping the inconsistent bits. The approach employs a small number of test channels I to supply a large number of internal scan chains 2(I) - 3 such that it can achieve significant reduction in test application time (TAT). Furthermore, as a non-intrusive and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) independent solution, the approach is suitable for IP core testing because it requires neither redesign of the core under test (CUT) nor running any additional ATPG for the encoding procedure. In addition, the decoder has low hardware overhead, and its design is independent of the CUT and the given test set. Theoretical analysis and experimental results for ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits have proven the efficiency of the proposed approach.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE network monitor; 10Gbps; PCI-X; DMA; timestamp
AB To apply network monitoring functions to emerging high-quality video streaming services, we proposed an application-coexistent monitor (APCM). In APCM, a streaming server can works as an active monitor and a passive monitor. In addition, IP packets sent from the server carry monitoring information together with application's data such as video signals. To achieve APCM on a 10-Gbps network, we developed a network interface card for an application-coexistent wire-rate network monitor (AWING NIC). It provides (1) a function to append GPS-based accurate timestamps to every packet that streaming applications send and receive, which can be used for real-time monitoring of delays and inter-packet gap, and (2) functions to capture and generate 10-Gbps wire-rate traffic without depending on packets' size, achieved by our highly-efficient DMA-transfer mechanisms. Such monitoring capability are unprecedented in existing PC-based systems because of the limitation in PC system's architecture. As an evaluation of APCM in an actual network, we conducted an experiment to transmit a 6-Gbps high-quality video stream over an IP network with the system in which we installed the AWING NIC. The results revealed that the video stream became highly bursty by passing through the network, and the observed smallest inter-packet gap corresponds to the value of 10-Gbps wire-rate traffic, which supports the effectiveness of our development.

AB The minimum vertex ranking spanning tree problem is to find a spanning tree of G whose vertex ranking is minimum. This problem is NP-hard and no polynomial time algorithm for solving it is known for non-trivial classes of graphs other than the class of interval graphs. This paper proposes a polynomial time algorithm for solving the minimum vertex ranking spanning tree problem on outerplanar graphs.

AB We consider a watermark application to assist in the integrity maintenance and verification of the associated images. There is a great benefit in using WM in the context of authentication since it does not require any additional storage space for supplementary metadata, in contrast with cryptographic signatures, for instance. However there is a fundamental problem in the case of exact authentication: How to embed a signature into a cover message in such a way that it would be possible to restore the watermarked cover image into its original state without any error? There are different approaches to solve this problem. We use the watermarking method consisting of modulo addition of a mark and investigate it in detail. Our contribution lies in investigating different modified techniques of both watermark embedding and detection in order to provide the best reliability of watermark authentication. The simulation results for different types of embedders and detectors in combination with the pictures of watermarked images are given.

AB A hybrid evolutionary neuro-fuzzy system (HENFS) is proposed in this paper, where the weighted Gaussian function (WGF) is used as the membership function for improved premise construction. With the WGF, different types of the membership functions (MFs) can be accommodated in the rule base of HENFS. A new hybrid algorithm of random optimization (RO) algorithm incorporated with the least square estimation (LSE) is presented. Based on the hybridization of RO-LSE, the proposed soft-computing approach overcomes the disadvantages of other widely used algorithms. The proposed HENFS is applied to chaos time series identification and industrial process modeling to verify its feasibility. Through the illustrations and comparisons the impressive performances for unknown system identification can be observed.

AB A novel approach for segmentation of grayscale images, which are color scene originally, is proposed. Many algorithms have been elaborated for grayscale image segmentation. All those approaches have been discussed in a luminance space, because it has been considered that grayscale images do not have any color information. However, a luminance value has color information as a set of corresponding colors. In this paper, an inverse mapping of luminance values is carried out to CIELAB color space, and the image segmentation for grayscale images is performed based on a distance in the color space. The proposed scheme is applied to a region growing segmentation and the performance is verified.

AB This paper proposes a technique for synthesizing speech with a desired speaking style and/or emotional expression, based on model adaptation in an HMM-based speech synthesis framework. Speaking styles and emotional expressions are characterized by many se.-mental and suprasegmental features in both spectral and prosodic features. Therefore. it is essential to take account of these features in the model adaptation. The proposed technique called style adaptation, deals with this issue. Firstly, the maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) algorithm, based on a framework of hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is presented to provide a mathematically rigorous and robust adaptation of state duration and to adapt both the spectral and prosodic features. Then, a novel tying method for the regression matrices of the MLLR algorithm is also presented to allow the incorporation of both the segmental and suprasegmental speech features into the style adaptation. The proposed tying method uses regression class trees with contextual information. From the results of several subjective tests, we show that these techniques can perform style adaptation while maintaining naturalness of the synthetic speech.

DE texture mapping onto arbitrary shaped surface; camera; video projector;
   homography; calibration free
AB In this paper, we propose a novel virtual display system for a real object surface by using a video projector, so that the viewer can feel as if digital images are printed on the real surface with arbitrary shape. This system consists of an uncalibrated camera and video projector connected to a same PC and creates a virtual object by rendering 2D contents preserved beforehand onto a white object in a real world via a projector. For geometry registration between the rendered image and the object surface correctly, we regard the object surface as a set of a number of small rectangular regions and perform geometry registration by calculating homographies between the projector image plane and the each divided regions. By using such a homography-based method, we can avoid calibration of a camera and a projector that is necessary in a conventional method. In this system, we perform following two processes. First of all, we acquire the status of the object surface from images which capture the scene that color-coded checker patterns are projected on it and generate image rendered on it without distortion by calculating homographies. After once the projection image is generated, the rendered image can be updated if the object surface moves, or refined when it is stationary by observing the object surface. By this second process, the system always offers more accurate display. In implementation, we demonstrate our system in various conditions. This system enables it to project them as if it is printed on a real paper surface of a book. By using this system, we expect the realization of a virtual museum or other industrial application.

DE XML query processing; full-text search; B+-tree; node labeling scheme
AB XML query processing is one of the most active areas of database research. Although the main focus of past research has been the processing of structural XML queries, there are growing demands for a full-text search for XML documents. In this paper, we propose XICS (XML Indices for Content and Structural search), which aims at high-speed processing of both full-text and structural queries in XML documents. An important design principle of our indices is the use of a B+-tree. To represent the structural information of XML trees, each node in the XML tree is labeled with an identifier. The identifier contains an integer number representing the path information from the root node. XICS consist of two types of indices, the COB-tree (COntent B+-tree) and the STB-tree (STructure B+-tree). The search keys of the COB-tree are a pair of text fragments in the XML document and the identifiers of the leaf nodes that contain the text, whereas the search keys of the STB-tree are the node identifiers. By using a node identifier in the search keys, we can retrieve only the entries that match the path information in the query. The STB-tree can filter nodes using structural conditions in queries, while the COB-tree can filter nodes using text conditions. We have implemented a COB-tree and an STB-tree using GiST and examined index size and query processing time. Our experimental results show the efficiency of XICS in query processing.

AB In this paper, we propose a construction method of three-dimensional deformable models that represent tree-shaped human organs, such as bronchial tubes, based on results obtained by statistically analyzing the distributions of bifurcation points in the tree-shaped organs. The models are made to be used as standard templates of tree-shaped organs in medical image recognition, and are formed by control points that can be uniquely identified as structural elements of organs such as bifurcation tracheae in bronchial tubes. They can be transfigured based on the statistical validity of relationships between the control points. The optimal state of that transfiguration is determined within the framework of energy minimization. Experimental results from bronchial tubes are shown on actual CT images.

   quality
AB Digital watermarks on pictures are more useful when they are better able tosurvive image processing operations and when they cause less degradation of picture quality. Random geometric distortion is one of the most difficult kinds of image processing for watermarks to survive because of the difficulty of synchronizing the expected watermark patterns to the watermarks embedded in pictures. This paper proposes three methods to improve a previous method that is not affected by this difficulty but that is insufficient in maintaining picture quality and treating other problems in surviving image processing. The first method determines the watermark strength in L*u*v* space, where human-perceived degradation of picture quality can be measured in terms of Euclidian distance, but embeds and detects watermarks in YUV space, where the detection is more reliable. The second method, based on the knowledge of image quantization, uses the messiness of color planes to hide watermarks. The third method reduces detection noises by preprocessing the watermarked image with orientation-sensitive image filtering, which is especially effective in picture portions where pixel values change drastically. Subjective evaluations have shown that these methods improved the picture quality of the previous method by 0.5 point of the mean evaluation score at the representative example case. On the other hand, the watermark strength of the previous method could be increased by 30% through 60% while keeping the same picture quality. Robustness to image processing has been evaluated for random geometric distortion, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise addition, and median filtering and it was clarified that these methods reduced the detection error ratio to 1/10 through 1/4. These methods can be applied not only to the previous method but also to other types of pixel-domain watermarking such as the Patchwork watermarking method and, with modification, to frequency-domain watermarking.

AB As a representative of the linear discriminant analysis, the Fisher method is most widely used in practice and it is very effective in two-class classification. However, when it is expanded to a multi-class classification problem, the precision of its discrimination may become worse. A main reason is an occurrence of overlapped distributions on the discriminant space built by Fisher criterion. In order to take such overlaps among classes into consideration, our approach builds a new discriminant space by hierarchically classifying the overlapped classes. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical discriminant analysis for texture classification. We divide the discriminant space into subspaces by recursively grouping the overlapped classes. In the experiment, texture images from many classes are classified based on the proposed method. We show the outstanding result compared with the conventional Fisher method.

AB Question answering (QA) is the task of retrieving an answer in response to a question by analyzing documents. Although most of the efforts in developing QA systems are devoted to dealing with electronic text, we consider it is also necessary to develop systems for document images. In this paper, we propose a method of document image retrieval for such QA systems. Since the task is not to retrieve all relevant documents but to find the answer somewhere in documents, retrieval should be precision oriented. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a method of improving precision of document image retrieval by taking into account the co-occurrence of successive terms in a question. The indexing scheme is based on two-dimensional distributions of terms and the weight of co-occurrence is measured by calculating the density distributions of terms. The proposed method was tested by using 1253 pages of documents about the major league baseball with 20 questions and found that it is superior to the baseline method proposed by the authors.

AB We proposed a fuzzy control scheme to implement the cycle-to-cycle control for restoring swing phase of gait using functional electrical stimulation (FES). We designed two fuzzy controllers for the biceps femoris short head (BFS) and the vastus muscles to control flexion and extension of the knee joint during the swing phase. Control capabilities of the designed fuzzy controllers were tested and compared to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and adaptive PID controllers in automatic generation of stimulation burst duration and compensation of muscle fatigue through computer simulations using a musculo-skeletal model. Parameter adaptations in the adaptive PID controllers did not significantly improve the control performance of the PID controllers. The fuzzy controllers were superior to the PID and adaptive PID controllers under several subject conditions and different fatigue levels. These results showed the fuzzy controller would be suitable to implement the cycle-to-cycle control of FES-induced gait.

AB Orthogonal space-time block codes (STBCs) [1], [2] appear to be a very fascinating means of enhancing reception quality in quasistatic MIMO channels due to their full diversity, and especially their simple maximum-likelihood (ML) decoders. However, full-rate full-diversity orthogonal STBCs do not exist for more than two transmit antennas. Vertical layered space-time architecture (so-called the V-BLAST) [3] with a nulling- and cancelling-based detection algorithm, in contrast, has an ability of achieving high transmission rates at the cost of having very low diversity gain, an undesirable consequence caused by the interference nulling and cancelling processes. The uncoded V-BLAST system is able to reach its ML performance with the aid of the sphere decoder algorithm [4] at the expense of higher detection complexity. Undoubtedly, the tradeoff between transmission rates, diversity, and complexity is inherent in designing space-time codes. This paper investigates a method to increase the "nulling diversity gains" for a general high-rate space-time code and introduces a new design strategy for high-rate space-time codes detected based on interference nulling and cancelling processes, thanks to which high-rate quasi-orthogonal space-time codes for MIMO applications are proposed. We show that when n(T) transmit and n(R) = n(T) receive antennas are deployed, the first code offers a transmission rate of (n(T) - 1) with a minimum nulling diversity order of 3, whereas the second one offers a transmission rate of (n(T) - 2) with a minimum nulling diversity order of 5. Therefore, the proposed codes significantly outperform the V-BLAST as n(R) = n(T). Simulation results and discussions on the performance of the proposed codes are provided.

AB In this paper, we propose a statistical model for detecting article errors, which Japanese learners of English often make in English writing. It is based on the three head words - the verb head, the preposition, and the noun head. To overcome the data sparseness problem, we apply the backed-off estimate to it. Experiments show that its performance (F-measure=0.70) is better than that of other methods. Apart from the performance, it has two advantages: (i) Rules for detecting article errors are automatically generated as conditional probabilities once a corpus is given; (ii) Its recall and precision rates are adjustable.

AB In this paper, the I-D real-valued discrete Gabor transform (RDGT) proposed in our previous work and its relationship with the complex-valued discrete Gabor transform (CDGT) are briefly reviewed. Block time-recursive RDGT algorithms for the efficient and fast computation of the I-D RDGT coefficients and for the fast reconstruction of the original signal from the coefficients are then developed in both the critical sampling case and the oversampling case. Unified parallel lattice structures for the implementation of the algorithms are studied. And the computational complexity analysis and comparison show that the proposed algorithms provide a more efficient and faster approach for the computation of the discrete Gabor transforms.

AB A new and simple image processing approach for the measurement of the length of pedestrian crossings with a view to develop a travel aid for the blind people is described. In a crossing, the usual black road surface is painted with constant width periodic white bands. The crossing length is estimated using vector geometry from the left- and the fight-border lines, the first-, the second- and the end-edge lines of the crossing region. Image processing techniques are applied on the crossing image to find these lines. Experimental results using real road scenes with pedestrian crossing confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB We introduce a method, so called FC method, for maintaining software resources. such as source codes and design documents, in consumer electronics products. Because a consumer electronics product is frequently and rapidly revised. software components in such product are also revised in the same way. However, it is not so easy for software engineers to follow the revision of the product because requirements changes for the product, including the changes of its functionalities and its hardware components, are largely independent of the structure of current software resources. FC method lets software engineers to restructure software resources, especially design documents, stepwise so as to follow the requirements changes for the product easily. We report an application of this method in our company to validate it. From the application, we can confirm that the quality of software was improved about in twice, and that efficiency of development process was also improved over four times.

AB The present paper describes a quality enhancement of band-limited speech signals. In regular telephone communication, the quality of the received speech signal is degraded by band limitation. We propose an effective but simple scheme for obtaining narrowband speech signals in which the frequency components are estimated from band limited signals. The proposed method utilizes aliasing components generated by wavelet reconstruction filters; in the inverse discrete wavelet transform. The results of enhancement have been verified by applying this method to speech samples via telephone lines to obtain a noticeable improvement in speech quality.

AB This paper describes a new multi-channel method of noisy speech recognition, which estimates the log spectrum of speech at a close-talking microphone based on the multiple regression of the log spectra (MRLS) of noisy signals captured by distributed microphones. The advantages of the proposed method are as follows: 1) The method does not require a sensitive geometric layout, calibration of the sensors nor additional pre-processing for tracking the speech source; 2) System works in very small computation amounts; and 3) Regression weights can be statistically optimized over the given training data. Once the optimal regression weights are obtained by regression learning, they can be utilized to generate the estimated log spectrum in the recognition phase, where the speech of close-talking is no longer required. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by speech recognition of real in-car dialogue data. In comparison to the nearest distant microphone and multi-microphone adaptive beamformer, the proposed approach obtains relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 9.8% and 3.6%, respectively.

ID PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
AB This paper presents an analysis of the applicability of Sparse Kernel Principal Component Analysis (SKPCA) for feature extraction in speech recognition, as well as, a proposed approach to make the SKPCA technique realizable for a large amount of training data, which is an usual context in speech recognition systems. Although the KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) has proved to be an efficient technique for being applied to speech recognition, it has the disadvantage of requiring training data reduction, when its amount is excessively large. This data reduction is important to avoid computational unfeasibility and/or an extremely high computational burden related to the feature representation step of the training and the test data evaluations. The standard approach to perform this data reduction is to randomly choose frames from the original data set, which does not necessarily provide a good statistical representation of the original data set. In order to solve this problem a likelihood related re-estimation procedure was applied to the KPCA framework, thus creating the SKPCA, which nevertheless is not realizable for large training databases. The proposed approach consists in clustering the training data and applying to these clusters a SKPCA like data reduction technique generating the reduced data clusters. These reduced data clusters are merged and reduced in a recursive procedure until just one cluster is obtained, making the SKPCA approach realizable for a large amount of training data. The experimental results show the efficiency of SKPCA technique with the proposed approach over the KPCA with the standard sparse solution using randomly chosen frames and the standard feature extraction techniques.

ID DISCRIMINATION
AB An unsupervised method for word-sense disambiguation using bilingual comparable corpora was developed. First, it extracts word associations, i.e., statistically significant pairs of associated words, from the corpus of each language. Then, it aligns word associations by consulting a bilingual dictionary and calculates correlation between senses of a target polysemous word and its associated words, which can be regarded as clues for identifying the sense of the target word. To overcome the problem of disparity of topical coverage between corpora of the two languages as well as the problem of ambiguity in word-association alignment, an algorithm for iteratively calculating a sense-vs.-clue correlation matrix for each target word was devised. Word-sense disambiguation for each instance of the target word is done by selecting the sense that maximizes the score, i.e., a weighted sum of the correlations between each sense and clues appearing in the context of the instance. An experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora together with the EDR bilingual dictionary showed that the new method has promising performance; namely, the F-measure of its sense selection was 74.6% compared to a baseline of 62.8%. The developed method will possibly be extended into a fully unsupervised method that features automatic division and definition of word senses.

A hierarchical 3D-torus (H3DT) network, which is a 3D-torus network of multiple basic modules in which the basic modules are 3D-mesh networks, has been proposed for efficient 3D-WSI. However, the restricted use of physical links between basic modules in the higher level networks reduces the dynamic communication performance of this network. A torus network has better dynamic communication performance than a mesh network. Therefore, we have modified the H3DT network by replacing the 3D-mesh modules by 3D-tori, calling it a Modified H3DT (MH3DT) network. This paper addresses the architectural details of the MH3DT network and explores aspects such as degree, diameter, cost, average distance, arc connectivity, bisection width, and wiring complexity. We also present a deadlock-free routing algorithm for the MH3DT network using two virtual channels and evaluate the network's dynamic communication performance under the uniform traffic pattern, using the proposed routing algorithm. It is shown that the MH3DT network possesses several attractive features including small diameter, small cost, small average distance, better bisection width, and better dynamic communication performance.

AB Given a graph G, we give a fast algorithm for approximating the vertex connectivity kappa of G. Our algorithm delivers a minimum vertex cut of G if kappa less than or equal to [delta/2], and returns a message "kappa > [delta/2]" otherwise, where delta denotes the minimum degree of G. The algorithm runs in O(n(2)(1 + min{kappa(2), kappa rootn}/delta)) time and O(n + m) space, where n and m denote the numbers of vertices and edges in G, respectively.

DE instantaneous frequency amplitude spectrum; harmonicity measure;
   fundamental frequency estimation
AB Borrowing the notion of instantaneous frequency that was developed in the context of time-frequency signal analysis, an instantaneous frequency amplitude spectrum (IFAS) is introduced for estimating fundamental frequency of speech signal in both noiseless and adverse environments. We define harmonicity measure as a quantity that indicates degree of periodical regularity in the IFAS and that shows substantial difference between periodic signal and noise-like waveform. The harmonicity measure is applied to estimate the existence of fundamental frequency. We provide experimental examples to demonstrate the general applicability of the harmonicity measure and apply the proposed procedure to Japanese continuous speech signals. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods with or without the presence of noise.

AB As Internet access had spread, it has become an important potential means of lifeline communication. The Internet can fulfill a role in the everyday life of citizens by offering lifeline communication services such as the police, ambulance, gas, electricity, and water services when an emergency occurs. In these lifeline communications, a caller needs to be able to communicate with the nearby lifeline service in the same manner as on a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Networks) without being consciously aware of the path the caller's message is taking. Moreover, the lifeline service agency must be able to acquire the caller's location and identity. However, it is very difficult to transfer these essential functions from the PSTN to the Internet without making significant changes, because of large differences between the PSTN and the Internet. In this paper, we discuss how to obtain these functions for lifeline communications in the Internet. We further propose a model and implement a lifeline communication system on the Internet.

DE requirement engineering; product-line; core asset; domain engineering;
   reuse
AB The methodologies of product-line engineering emphasize proactive reuse to construct high-quality products more quickly that are less costly. Requirement engineering for software product families differs significantly from requirement engineering for single software products. The requirements for a product line are written for the group of systems as a whole, with requirements for individual systems specified by a delta or an increment to the generic set [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and explicitly denote the regions of commonality and points of variation at the requirement level. In this paper, we suggest a method of producing requirements that will be a core asset in the product line. Briefly, requirements for families of similar systems (i.e. domain) are collected and generalized which are then analyzed and modeled. The domain requirement as a core asset explicitly manages the commonality and variability. Through this method, the reuse of domain requirements can be enhanced. As a result, the cost and time of software development can be reduced and the productivity increased while significantly reducing error in the requirements.

DE Internet; performance; passive measurement; packet loss
AB Performance measurements are indispensable for managing the Internet. Among the performance measurement techniques known, passive measurement is attractive because of its accuracy; user traffic is observed without inserting additional test traffic. However, the technique is handicapped by its large storage and bandwidth costs. This paper proposes a passive packet loss measurement technique that effectively avoids the difficulty of the conventional passive measurement approaches. Its key advance is utilizing the packet feature computed by a hash function. Since the feature can identify a packet with a short length of data, it becomes possible to greatly decrease the storage and bandwidth costs of passive measurements. The paper details the measurement procedure and assesses the design parameters used in the method. In addition, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed through experiments. The experiments also show the advantage of the method over the conventional active measurement.

AB We propose a method to determine accurate motion fields and illumination conditions such as non-uniform or non-stationary illuminations. The method extends a stabilization method using reliability indices of optical flow to combine with a gradient-based approach that determines a motion field and illumination conditions simultaneously. We applied the proposed method to two synthetic image sequences and a standard image sequence. The method is effective for image sequences including poorly textured areas, edges of brightness variation, and almost dark objects.

AB Cluster computation has been used in the applications that demand performance, reliability, and availability, such as cluster server groups, large-scale scientific computations, distributed databases, distributed media-on-demand servers and search engines etc. In those applications, multicast can play the vital roles for the information dissemination among groups of servers and users. This paper proposes a set of novel efficient fault-tolerant multicast routing algorithms on hypercube interconnection of cluster computers using multicast shared tree approach. We present some new algorithms for selecting an optimal core (root) and constructing the shared tree so as to minimize the average delay for multicast messages. Simulation results indicate that our algorithms are efficient in the senses of short end-to-end average delay, load balance and less resource utilizations over hypercube cluster interconnection networks.

AB This paper proposes a new supply current test method for detecting floating gate defects in CMOS ICs. In the method, unusual increase of the supply current caused by defects is promoted by superposing an AC component on the DC power supply. Feasibility of the test is examined by some experiments on four DUTs with an intentionally caused defect. The results showed that our method could detect clearly all the defects, one of which may be detected by neither any functional logic test nor any conventional supply current test.

TI A new similarity measure to understand visitor behavior in a Web site
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Web mining; browsing behavior; similarity measure; clustering
AB The behavior of visitors browsing in a web site offers a lot of information about their requirements and the way they use the respective site. Analyzing such behavior can provide the necessary information in order to improve the web site's structure. The literature contains already several suggestions on how to characterize web site usage and to identify the respective visitor requirements based on clustering of visitor sessions. Here we propose to combine visitor behavior with the content of the respective web pages and the similarity between different page sequences in order to define a similarity measure between different visits. This similarity serves as input for clustering of visitor sessions. The application of our approach to a bank's web site and its visitor sessions shows its potential for internet-based businesses.

ID VALIDATION
AB Nowadays, the use of dependable systems is generalising, and diagnosis is an important step during their design. A diagnosis in early phases of the design cycle allows to save time and money. Fault injection can be used during the design process of the system, and using Hardware Description Languages, particularly VHDL, it is possible to accomplish this early diagnosis. During last years, the Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA) has emerged as a hard real-time fault-tolerant architecture for embedded systems. This novel architecture is gaining adepts mainly in the avionics and automotive industries (x-by-wire). The TTA implements a synchronous protocol with static scheduling that has been specifically targeted at hard real-time fault-tolerant distributed system. In this work, we present the study of the VHDL model of a communication controller based on the TTA, where a number of fault injection campaigns have been carried out. We comment the results produced and suggest some solutions to problems detected.

AB In this paper, supply current testing for detecting open defects in CMOS circuits is discussed. It is known that open defects cause unpredictable faulty effects and are difficult to be detected. In our test method, an AC electric field is applied during testing. The voltage at a floating node caused by an open defect is varied by the applied electric field and then the defect can be detected. The test pattern generation procedure for open defects is proposed and is applied to benchmark circuits. The experimental results shows that the number of test vectors for opens are much smaller than that for stuck-at faults. The experimental evaluation for an LSI chip is also shown to present the feasibility of our test method.

AB We have developed an OC-48c (2.4 Gbps) PCI-compliant network interface card and drivers with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed link layer protocol MAPOS. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of MAPOS particularly from the viewpoint of the influence of packet sizes up to the 64-kbyte jumbo MTU size and the effectiveness of our new implementation of the non-interrupt-driven sending process and interrupt hatching receiving process deployed to improve the throughput in short-packet transmissions. Our main findings are as follows;
   Enlarging the packet size up to 64-kbyte MTU improves the performance in transmission. OC-48c wire speed is achieved with packet sizes larger than 16 kbytes.
   Implementation of the non-interrupt-driven sending process and the interrupt batching receiving process improves the performance of short-packet transmission. In particular, the transmission throughput is improved by 50% when 64-byte short packets are used. The maximum loss-free receive rate is also raised by 50% when 4-kbyte packets arrive.
   With a high-performance CPU. the data-transfer speed of the DMA controller for jumbo packets cannot keep up with the packet-queueing speed of the CPU. Our proposed procedure for adaptive algorithm switching method can resolve this problem.
   The maximum TCP throughput observed in our measurement using the latest PCs and MAPOS OC-48c PCI card was 2342.5 Mbps. This throughput represents the highest performance in a legacy-PCI-based system according to the results database of the benchmarking software.

AB At the initial stage of developing parallel machines, a software monitor. which manages communication between host computers, program loading and debugging, is necessary. However, it is often a cumbersome job to develop such a monitoring system especially when the target takes a parallel architecture. To solve this problem, we developed an integrated monitor system called "Pot". "Pot" consists of a system runs on the host computer and simple code on a target machine. In order to reduce the development costs, the program on a target machine is as simple as possible while "Pot" on the host computer itself provides various functions for system development.

DE Thai speech synthesis; Thai tone; tone analysis; Fujisaki's model;

AB We have developed Thai speech synthesis by rule rising cepstral parameters. In order to synthesize the pitch contour of Thai tones, we have applied an extension of Fujisaki's model. A mid tone is unique for Thai when compared to Chinese. For the extension of Fujisaki's model to Thai tones, we assumed that the rind tone is neutral and we adopted its phrase component as the phrase components for all tones. According to our study on the pitch contour of five Thai tones using this model, the result shows that the command pattern for the local F-0 components needs both positive and negative commands. Listening tests showed that the intelligibility of the Thai tones measured in terms of error rate were 0.0%, 0.7% and 2.7% for analysis/synthesis, Fujisaki's model and the polynomial model, respectively. Therefore, it is shown that the extension of Fujisaki's model is effective for Thai.

AB A brain-computer interface using an electroencephalogram as input into an artificial neural network is investigated as a potentially general control system applicable to all subjects and time frames. Using the intent and imagination of bending the left or right elbow, the left and right desired movements are successfully distinguished using event-related desynchronization resolved by fast Fourier transformation of the electroencephalogram and analysis of the power spectrum using the artificial neural network. The influence of age was identified and eliminated through the use of a frequency distribution in the alpha band, and the recognition rate was further improved by confirmation based on forced excitement of the beta band in the case of an error. The proposed system was effectively trained for general use by using the combined data of a cross-section of subjects.

AB The existing methods for the reconstruction of a super-resolution image from a sequence of undersampled and subpixel shifted images have to solve a large ill-condition equation group by approximately finding the pseudo-inverse matrix or performing many iterations to approach the solution. The former leads to a big burden of computation, and the latter causes the artifacts or noise to be stressed. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, we consider applying pyramid structure to the super-resolution of the image sequence and present a suitable pyramid framework, called Super-Resolution Image Pyramid (SRIP). Based on the imaging process of the image sequence, the proposed method divides a big back-projection into a series of different levels of small back-projections, thereby avoiding the above problems. As an example, the Iterative Back-Projection (IBP) suggested by Peleg is included in this pyramid framework. Computer simulations and error analyses are conducted and the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated. The image resolution can be improved better even in the case of severely undersampled images. In addition, the other general super-resolution methods can be easily included in this framework and done in parallel so as to meet the need of real-time processing.

AB Recent advances of Web information systems such as e-commerce and e-learning have created very large but hidden demands on conceptual multiresolution analysis for more generalized information analysis, cognition and modeling. To meet the demands in a general way, its modeling is formulated based on modern algebraic topology. To be specific, the modeling formulation is worked out in an incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy with emphasis on the two levels of the hierarchy appropriate for conceptual modeling: the adjunction space level and the cellular structured space level. Examples are shown to demonstrate the usefulness of the presented model as well as an implementation of a flower structure case.

TI Compression of 3D models by remesh on texture images

DT Article
DE 3D model; compression; regular mesh; texture
AB Due to the rapid development of computer and information technology, 3D modeling and rendering capabilities are becoming increasingly important in many applications, including industrial design, architecture, CAD/CAM, video games, and medical imaging. Since 3D mesh models often have huge amounts of the data, it is time-consuming to retrieve front a storage device or to download from the network. Most 3D viewing applications need to obtain the entire file of a 3D model in order to display the model, even when the user is interested only in a low-resolution version of the model. Therefore, progressive coding that enables multiresolution transmission of 3D models is desired. In this paper, we propose the progressive coding scheme of 3D meshes with texture, in which we convert irregular meshes to semi-regular using texture coordinates, map them on planes, and apply 2D image coding algorithm to mesh compression. As our method uses the wavelet transform, the encoded bitstream has a progressive nature. We gain high compression rate with the same visual quality as original models.

TI Filter bank subtraction for robust speech recognition
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE filter bank; spectral subtraction; speech recognition; noise
AB In this paper, we propose a new technique of filter bank subtraction for robust speech recognition under various acoustic conditions. Spectral subtraction is a simple and useful technique for reducing the influence of additive noise. Conventional spectral subtraction assumes accurate estimation of the noise spectrum and no correlation between speech and noise. Those assumptions, however, are rarely satisfied in reality, leading to the degradation of speech recognition accuracy. Moreover, the recognition improvement attained by conventional methods is slight when the input SNR changes sharply. We propose a new method in which the output values of filter banks are used for noise estimation and subtraction. By estimating noise at each filter bank, instead of at each frequency point, the method alleviates the necessity for precise estimation of noise. We also take into consideration expected phase differences between the spectra of speech and noise in the subtraction and control a subtraction coefficient theoretically. Recognition experiments on test sets at several SNRs showed that the filter bank subtraction technique improved the word accuracy significantly and got better results than conventional spectral subtraction on all the test sets. In other experiments, on recognizing speech from TV news field reports with environmental noise, the proposed subtraction method yielded better results than the conventional method.

AB There is a strong demand to expand captioned broadcasting for TV news programs in Japan. However, keyboard entry of captioned manuscripts for news program cannot keep pace with the speed of speech, because in the case of Japanese it takes time to select the correct characters from among homonyms. In order to implement simultaneous subtitled broadcasting for Japanese news programs, a simultaneous subtitling system by speech recognition has been developed. This system consists of a real-time speech recognition system to handle broadcast news transcription and a recognition-error correction system that manually corrects mistakes in the recognition result with short delay time. NHK started simultaneous subtitled broadcasting for the news program "News 7" on the evening of March 27, 2000.

AB The maximal independent set (MIS) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in the field of distributed computing. This paper focuses on the MIS problem with unreliable communication between processes in the system. We propose a relaxed notion of MIS, named almost MIS (ALMIS), and show that the loosely-stabilizing algorithm proposed in our previous work can achieve exponentially long holding time with logarithmic convergence time and space complexity regarding ALMIS, which cannot be achieved at the same time regarding MIS in our previous work.

AB Driver fatigue detection has become crucial in vehicle safety technology. Achieving high accuracy and real-time performance in detecting driver fatigue is paramount. In this paper, we propose a novel driver fatigue detection algorithm based on dynamic tracking of Facial Eyes and Yawning using YOLOv7, named FEY-YOLOv7. The Coordinate At-tention module is inserted into YOLOv7 to enhance its dynamic tracking accuracy by focusing on coordinate information. Additionally, a small tar -get detection head is incorporated into the network architecture to promote the feature extraction ability of small facial targets such as eyes and mouth. In terms of compution, the YOLOv7 network architecture is significantly simplified to achieve high detection speed. Using the proposed PERYAWN algorithm, driver status is labeled and detected by four classes: open eye, closed eye, open mouth, and closed mouth. Furthermore, the Guided Im-age Filtering algorithm is employed to enhance image details. The pro-posed FEY-YOLOv7 is trained and validated on RGB-infrared datasets. The results show that FEY-YOLOv7 has achieved mAP of 0.983 and FPS of 101. This indicates that FEY-YOLOv7 is superior to state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed, providing an effective and practical solu-tion for image-based driver fatigue detection.

TI Facial Mask Completion Using StyleGAN2 Preserving Features of the Person
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE image completion; image inpainting; GAN; facial mask
AB Due to the global outbreak of coronaviruses, people are increasingly wearing masks even when photographed. As a result, photos uploaded to web pages and social networking services with the lower half of the face hidden are less likely to convey the attractiveness of the pho-tographed persons. In this study, we propose a method to complete facial mask regions using StyleGAN2, a type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In the proposed method, a reference image of the same person without a mask is prepared separately from a target image of the person wearing a mask. After the mask region in the target image is temporarily inpainted, the face orientation and contour of the person in the reference image are changed to match those of the target image using StyleGAN2. The changed image is then composited into the mask region while cor-recting the color tone to produce a mask-free image while preserving the features.

TI File Tracking and Visualization Methods Using a Network Graph to Prevent
   Information Leakage*
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE information leakage; network graph; pruning
AB Information leakage is a significant threat to organizations, and effective measures are required to protect information assets. As confidential files can be leaked through various paths, a countermeasure is necessary to prevent information leakage from various paths, from simple drag-and-drop movements to complex transformations such as encryption and encoding. However, existing methods are difficult to take countermeasures depending on the information leakage paths. Furthermore, it is also necessary to create a visualization format that can find information leakage easily and a method that can remove unnecessary parts while leaving the necessary parts of information leakage to improve visibility. This paper proposes a new information leakage countermeasure method that incorporates file tracking and visualization. The file tracking component recursively extracts all events related to confidential files. Therefore, tracking is possible even when data have transformed significantly from the original file. The visualization component represents the results of file tracking as a network graph. This allows security administrators to find information leakage even if a file is transformed through multiple events. Furthermore, by pruning the network graph using the frequency of past events, the indicators of information leakage can be more easily found by security administrators. In experiments conducted, network graphs were generated for two information leakage scenarios in which files were moved and copied. The visualization results were obtained according to the scenarios, and the network graph was pruned to reduce vertices by 17.6% and edges by 10.9%.

AB Car navigation systems provide traffic jam information. In this study, we attempt to provide more detailed traffic jam information that considers the lane in which a traffic jam is in. This makes it possible for users to avoid long waits in queued traffic going toward an unintended destination. Lane-specific traffic jam detection utilizes image processing, which incurs long processing time and high cost. To reduce these, we pro-pose a "suddenness index (SI)" to categorize candidate areas as sudden or periodic. Sudden traffic jams are prioritized as they may lead to accidents. This technology aggregates the number of connected cars for each mesh on a map and quantifies the degree of deviation from the ordinary state. In this paper, we evaluate the proposed method using actual global position-ing system (GPS) data and found that the proposed index can cover 100% of sudden lane-specific traffic jams while excluding 82.2% of traffic jam candidates. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of time savings by inte-grating the proposed method into a demonstration framework. In addition, we improved the proposed method's ability to automatically determine the SI threshold to select the appropriate traffic jam candidates to avoid manual parameter settings.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Medical images play an important role in medical diagno-sis. However, acquiring a large number of datasets with annotations is still a difficult task in the medical field. For this reason, research in the field of image-to-image translation is combined with computer-aided diagnosis, and data augmentation methods based on generative adversarial networks are applied to medical images. In this paper, we try to perform data aug-mentation on unimodal data. The designed StarGAN V2 based network has high performance in augmenting the dataset using a small number of original images, and the augmented data is expanded from unimodal data to multimodal medical images, and this multimodal medical image data can be applied to the segmentation task with some improvement in the segmen-tation results. Our experiments demonstrate that the generated multimodal medical image data can improve the performance of glioma segmentation.

AB We present a mathematical formulation of a trust metric using a quality and quantity pair. Under a certain assumption, we regard trust as an additive value and define the soundness of a trust computation as not to exceed the total sum. Moreover, we point out the importance of not only soundness of each computed trust but also the stability of the trust computation procedure against changes in trust value assignment. In this setting, we define trust composition operators. We also propose a trust computation protocol and prove its soundness and stability using the oper-ators.

AB This study presents a selective data-compression intercon-nection network to boost its performance. Data compression virtually in-creases the effective network bandwidth. One drawback of data compres-sion is a long latency to perform (de-)compression operation at a compute node. In terms of the communication latency, we explore the trade-off between the compression latency overhead and the reduced injection la-tency by shortening the packet length by compression algorithms. As a result, we present to selectively apply a compression technique to a packet. We perform a compression operation to long packets and it is also taken when network congestion is detected at a source compute node. Through a cycle-accurate network simulation, the selective compression method us-ing the above compression algorithms improves by up to 39% the network throughput with a moderate increase in the communication latency of short packets.

TI Geometric Partitioning Mode with Inter and Intra Prediction for Beyond
   Versatile Video Coding
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE &nbsp; video coding; geometric partitioning mode (GPM); inter
   pre-diction; intra prediction; versatile video coding (VVC)
AB Geometric partitioning mode (GPM) is a new inter pre-diction tool adopted in versatile video coding (VVC), which is the latest video coding of international standard developed by joint video expert team in 2020. Different from the regular inter prediction performed on rectan-gular blocks, GPM separates a coding block into two regions by the pre-defined 64 types of straight lines, generates inter predicted samples for each separated region, and then blends them to obtain the final inter predicted samples. With this feature, GPM improves the prediction accuracy at the boundary between the foreground and background with different motions. However, GPM has room to further improve the prediction accuracy if the final predicted samples can be generated using not only inter prediction but also intra prediction. In this paper, we propose a GPM with inter and in-tra prediction to achieve further enhanced compression capability beyond VVC. To maximize the coding performance of the proposed method, we also propose the restriction of the applicable intra prediction mode number and the prohibition of applying the intra prediction to both GPM-separated regions. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the coding performance gain by the conventional GPM method of VVC by 1.3 times, and provides an additional coding performance gain of 1% bitrate savings in one of the coding structures for low-latency video transmission where the conventional GPM method cannot be utilized.

AB We investigate a problem of finding the minimum, in which each user has a real value, and we want to estimate the minimum of these values under the local differential privacy constraint. We reveal that this problem is fundamentally difficult, and we cannot construct a consistent mechanism in the worst case. Instead of considering the worst case, we aim to construct a private mechanism whose error rate is adaptive to the easiness of estimation of the minimum. As a measure of easiness, we introduce a parameter alpha that characterizes the fatness of the minimum-side tail of the user data distribution. As a result, we reveal that the mechanism can achieve O((ln(6) N/epsilon N-2)(1/2 alpha)) error without knowledge of a and the error rate is near-optimal in the sense that any mechanism incurs Omega((1/epsilon(2) N)(1/2a)) error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms a naive mechanism by empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets. Also, we conducted experiments on the MovieLens dataset and a purchase history dataset and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves (O) over tilde((1/N)(1/2a)) error adaptively to a.

AB To alleviate the problem of the dependency on the quantity of the training sample data in speech emotion recognition, a weighted gradient pre-train algorithm for low-resource speech emotion recognition is proposed. Multiple public emotion corpora are used for pre-training to generate shared hidden layer (SHL) parameters with the generalization ability. The parameters are used to initialize the downsteam network of the recognition task for the low-resource dataset, thereby improving the recognition performance on low-resource emotion corpora. However, the emotion categories are different among the public corpora, and the number of samples varies greatly, which will increase the difficulty of joint training on multiple emotion datasets. To this end, a weighted gradient (WG) algorithm is proposed to enable the shared layer to learn the generalized representation of different datasets without affecting the priority of the emotion recognition on each corpus. Experiments show that the accuracy is improved by using CASIA, IEMOCAP, and eNTERFACE as the known datasets to pre-train the emotion models of GEMEP, and the performance could be improved further by combining WG with gradient reversal layer.

AB A mobile crowdsensing system (MCS) utilizes a crowd of users to collect large-scale data using their mobile devices efficiently. The collected data are usually linked with sensitive information, raising the concerns of user privacy leakage. To date, many approaches have been proposed to protect the users' privacy, with the majority relying on a centralized structure, which poses though attack and intrusion vulnerability. Some studies build a distributed platform exploiting a blockchain-type solution, which still requires a fully trusted third party (TTP) to manage a reliable reward distribution in the MCS. Spurred by the deficiencies of current methods, we propose a distributed user privacy protection structure that combines blockchain and a trusted execution environment (TEE). The proposed architecture successfully manages the users' privacy protection and an accurate reward distribution without requiring a TTP. This is because the encryption algorithms ensure data confidentiality and uncouple the correlation between the users' identity and the sensitive information in the collected data. Accordingly, the smart contract signature is used to manage the user deposit and verify the data. Extensive comparative experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed combined blockchain and TEE scheme.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for image processing tasks in both embedded systems and data centers. In data centers, high accuracy and low latency are desired for various tasks such as image processing of streaming videos. We propose an FPGA-based low-latency CNN inference for randomly wired convolutional neural networks (RWCNNs), whose layer structures are based on random graph models. Because RWCNNs have several convolution layers that have no direct dependencies between them, our architecture can process them efficiently using a pipeline method. At each layer, we need to use the calculation results of multiple layers as the input. We use an FPGA with HBM2 to enable parallel access to the input data with multiple HBM2 channels. We schedule the order of execution of the layers to improve the pipeline efficiency. We build a conflict graph using the scheduling results. Then, we allocate the calculation results of each layer to the HBM2 channels by coloring the graph. Because the pipeline execution needs to be properly controlled, we developed an automatic generation tool for hardware functions. We implemented the proposed architecture on the Alveo U50 FPGA. We investigated a trade-off between latency and recognition accuracy for the ImageNet classification task by comparing the inference performances for different input image sizes. We compared our accelerator with a conventional accelerator for ResNet-50. The results show that our accelerator reduces the latency by 2.21 times. We also obtained 12.6 and 4.93 times better efficiency than CPU and GPU, respectively. Thus, our accelerator for RWCNNs is suitable for low-latency inference.

AB This paper studies using price incentives to shift band-width demand from peak to non-peak periods. In particular, cost discounts decrease as peak monthly usage increases. We take into account the delay sensitivity of different apps: during peak hours, the usage of hard real-time applications (HRAS) is not counted in the user's monthly data cap, while the usage of other applications (OAS) is counted in the user's monthly data cap. As a result, users may voluntarily delay or abandon OAS in order to get a higher fee discount. Then, a new data rate control algorithm is proposed. The algorithm allocates the data rate according to the priority of the source, which is determined by two factors: (I) the allocated data rate; and (II) the waiting time.

AB Since HEVC intra rate control has no prior information to rely on for coding, it is a difficult work to obtain the optimal lambda for every coding tree unit (CTU). In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based intra rate control is proposed. Firstly, a CNN with two last output channels is used to predict the key parameters of the CTU R-lambda curve. For well training the CNN, a combining loss function is built and the balance factor gamma is explored to achieve the minimum loss result. Secondly, the initial CTU lambda can be calculated by the predicted results of the CNN and the allocated bit per pixel (bpp). According to the rate distortion optimization (RDO) of a frame, a spatial equation is derived between the CTU lambda and the frame lambda. Lastly, The CTU clipping function is used to obtain the optimal CTU lambda for the intra rate control. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the intra rate control performance significantly with a good rate control accuracy.

AB Single image dehazing algorithm based on Dark Channel Prior (DCP) is widely known. More and more image dehazing algorithms based on DCP have been proposed. However, we found that it is more effective to use DCP in the RAW images before the ISP pipeline. In addition, for the problem of DCP failure in the sky area, we propose an algorithm to segment the sky region and compensate the transmission. Extensive experimental results on both subjective and objective evaluation demonstrate that the performance of the modified DCP (MDCP) has been greatly improved, and it is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB The reconnaissance mode with the cooperation of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with airborne visual tracking platforms is a common practice for localizing a target. Apart from the random noises from sensors, the localization performance is much dependent on their cooperative trajectories. In our previous work, we have proposed a cooperative trajectory generating method that proves better than EKF based method. In this letter, an improved online trajectory generating method is proposed to enhance the previous one. First, the least square estimation method has been replaced with a geometric-optimization based estimation method, which can obtain a better estimation performance than the least square method proposed in our previous work; second, in the trajectory optimization phase, the position error caused by estimation method is also considered, which can further improve the optimization performance of the next way points of the two UAVs. The improved method can well be applied to the two-UAV trajectory planning for corporative target localization, and the simulation results confirm that the improved method achieves an obviously better localization performance than our previous method and the EKF-based method.

ID KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION
AB Multimedia data and information management is an important task according to the development of media processing technology. Multimedia is a useful resource that people understand complex situations such as the elderly care domain. Appropriate annotation is beneficial in several tasks of information management, such as storing, retrieval, and summarization of data, from a semantic perspective. However, the meta-data annotation for multimedia data remains problematic because meta-data is obtained as a result of interpretation depending on domain-specific knowledge, and it needs well-controlled and comprehensive vocabulary for annotation. In this study, we proposed a collaborative methodology for developing ontologies and annotation with domain experts. The method includes (1) classification of knowledge types for collaborative construction of annotation data, (2) division of tasks among a team composed of domain experts, ontology engineers, and annotators, and (3) incremental approach to ontology development. We applied the proposed method to 11 videos on elderly care domain for the confirmation of its feasibility. We focused on annotation of actions occurring in these videos, thereby the annotated data is used as a support in evaluating staff skills. The application results show the content in the ontology during annotation increases monotonically. The number of "action concepts" is saturated and reused among the case studies. This demonstrates that the ontology is reusable and could represent various case studies by using a small number of "action concepts". This study concludes by presenting lessons learnt from the case studies.

AB With the widespread diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT), the number of applications using wireless sensor devices are increasing, and Quality of Service (QoS) required for these applications is diversifying. Thus, it becomes difficult to satisfy a variety of QoS with a single wireless system, and many kinds of wireless systems are working in the same domains; time, frequency, and place. This paper considers coexistence environments of ZigBee and Wi-Fi networks, which use the same frequency band channels, in the same place. In such coexistence environments, ZigBee devices suffer radio interference from Wi-Fi networks, which results in severe ZigBee packet losses because the transmission power of Wi-Fi is much higher than that of ZigBee. Many existing methods to avoid interference from Wi-Fi networks focus on only one of time, frequency, or space domain. However, such avoidance in one domain is insufficient particularly in near future IoT environments where more ZigBee devices and Wi-Fi stations transfer more amount of data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose joint channel allocation and routing in both frequency and space domains. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by computer simulation.

AB Abnormal behavior detection is now a widely concerned research field, especially for crowded scenes. However, most traditional unsupervised approaches often suffered from the problem when the normal events in the scenario with large visual variety. This paper proposes a self-learning probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, which aims at taking full advantage of the high-level abnormal information to solve problems. We select the informative observations to construct the "reference events" from the training sets as a high-level guidance cue. Specifically, the training set is randomly divided into two separate subsets. One is used to learn this model, which is defined as the initialization sequence of "reference events". The other aims to update this model and the the infrequent samples are chosen into the "reference events". Finally, we define anomalies using events that are least similar to "reference events". The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed model can detect anomalies accurately and robustly in the real-world crowd environment.

AB Neural networks have received considerable attention in sentence similarity measuring systems due to their efficiency in dealing with semantic composition. However, existing neural network methods are not sufficiently effective in capturing the most significant semantic information buried in an input. To address this problem, a novel weighted-pooling attention layer is proposed to retain the most remarkable attention vector. It has already been established that long short-term memory and a convolution neural network have a strong ability to accumulate enriched patterns of whole sentence semantic representation. First, a sentence representation is generated by employing a siamese structure based on bidirectional long short-termmemory and a convolutional neural network. Subsequently, a weighted-pooling attention layer is applied to obtain an attention vector. Finally, the attention vector pair information is leveraged to calculate the score of sentence similarity. An amalgamation of both, bidirectional long short-term memory and a convolutional neural network has resulted in a model that enhances information extracting and learning capacity. Investigations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches to datasets for two tasks, namely semantic relatedness and Microsoft research paraphrase identification. The new model improves the learning capability and also boosts the similarity accuracy as well.

AB In the statistic en-route filtering, each report generation node must collect a certain number of endorsements from its neighboring nodes. However, at some point, a node may fail to collect an insufficient number of endorsements since some of its neighboring nodes may have dead batteries. This letter presents a report generation method that can enhance the generation process of sensing reports under such a situation. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB While existing inference engines solved real world problems using probabilistic knowledge representation, one challenging task is to efficiently utilize the representation under a situation of uncertainty during conflict resolution. This paper presents a new approach to straightforwardly combine a rule-based system (RB) with a probabilistic graphical inference framework, i.e., naive Bayesian network (BN), towards probabilistic argumentation via a so-called probabilistic assumption-based argumentation (PABA) framework. A rule-based system (RB) formalizes its rules into defeasible logic under the assumption-based argumentation (ABA) framework while the Bayesian network (BN) provides probabilistic reasoning. By knowledge integration, while the former provides a solid testbed for inference, the latter helps the former to solve persistent conflicts by setting an acceptance threshold. By experiments, effectiveness of this approach on conflict resolution is shown via an example of liver disorder diagnosis.

AB The simultaneous utterances impact the ability of both the hearing-impaired persons and automatic speech recognition systems. Recently, deep neural networks have dramatically improved the speech separation performance. However, most previous works only estimate the speech magnitude and use the mixture phase for speech reconstruction. The use of the mixture phase has become a critical limitation for separation performance. This study proposes a two-stage phase-aware approach for multi-talker speech separation, which integrally recovers the magnitude as well as the phase. For the phase recovery, Multiple Input Spectrogram Inversion (MISI) algorithm is utilized due to its effectiveness and simplicity. The study implements the MISI algorithm based on the mask and gives that the ideal amplitude mask (IAM) is the optimal mask for the mask-based MISI phase recovery, which brings less phase distortion. To compensate for the error of phase recovery and minimize the signal distortion, an advanced mask is proposed for the magnitude estimation. The IAM and the proposed mask are estimated at different stages to recover the phase and the magnitude, respectively. Two frameworks of neural network are evaluated for the magnitude estimation on the second stage, demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly minimizes the distortions of the separated speech.

AB In this paper, we propose homomorphic encryption based device owner equality verification (HE-DOEV), a new method to verify whether the owners of two devices are the same. The proposed method is expected to be used for credential sharing among devices owned by the same user. Credential sharing is essential to improve the usability of devices with hardware-assisted trusted environments, such as a secure element (SE) and a trusted execution environment (TEE), for securely storing credentials such as private keys. In the HE-DOEV method, we assume that the owner of every device is associated with a public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by an identity provider (IdP), where a PKI certificate is used to authenticate the owner of a device. In the HE-DOEV method, device owner equality is collaboratively verified by user devices and IdPs that issue PKI certificates to them. The HE-DOEV method verifies device owner equality under the condition where multiple IdPs can issue PKI certificates to user devices. In addition, it can verify the equality of device owners without disclosing to others any privacy-related information such as personally identifiable information and long-lived identifiers managed by an entity. The disclosure of privacy-related information is eliminated by using homomorphic encryption. We evaluated the processing performance of a server needed for an IdP in the HE-DOEV method. The evaluation showed that the HE-DOEV method can provide a DOEV service for 100 million users by using a small-scale system in terms of the number of servers.

AB Due to the superior performance, deep learning has been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity. Nevertheless, the research investigations on deep learning in the adversarial environment are still on their preliminary stage. The emerging adversarial learning methods, e.g., generative adversarial networks, have introduced two vital questions: to what degree the security of deep learning with the presence of adversarial examples is; how to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in adversarial environment, thus, to raise security advice such that the selected application system based on deep learning is resistant to adversarial examples. To see the answers, we leverage image classification as an example application scenario to propose a framework of Evaluating Deep Learning for Image Classification (EDLIC) to conduct comprehensively quantitative analysis. Moreover, we introduce a set of evaluating metrics to measure the performance of different attacking and defensive techniques. After that, we conduct extensive experiments towards the performance of deep learning for image classification under different adversarial environments to validate the scalability of EDLIC. Finally, we give some advice about the selection of deep learning models for image classification based on these comparative results.

AB Real-time pulse rate (PR) monitoring based on photo-plethysmography (PPG) has been drawn much attention in recent years. However, PPG signal detected under movement is easily affected by random noises, especially motion artifacts (MA), affecting the accuracy of PR estimation. In this paper, a parallel method structure is proposed, which effectively combines wavelet threshold denoising with recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filtering to remove interference signals, and uses spectral peak tracking algorithm to estimate real-time PR. Furthermore, we propose a parallel structure RLS adaptive filtering to increase the amplitude of spectral peak associated with PR for PR estimation. This method is evaluated by using the PPG datasets of the 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Cup. Experimental results on the 12 training datasets during subjects' walking or running show that the average absolute error (AAE) is 1.08 beats per minute (BPM) and standard deviation (SD) is 1.45 BPM. In addition, the AAE of PR on the 10 testing datasets during subjects' fast running accompanied with wrist movements can reach 2.90 BPM. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed approach keeps high estimation accuracy of PPG signal even with strong MA.

TI ASAN: Self-Attending and Semantic Activating Network towards Better
   Object Detection
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE object detection; self-attending; semantic activating
AB Recent top-performing object detectors usually depend on a two-stage approach, which benefits from its region proposal and refining practice but suffers low detection speed. By contrast, one-stage approaches have the advantage of high efficiency while sacrifice their accuracies to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot object detection network which inherits the merits of both. Motivated by the idea of semantic enrichment to the convolutional features within a typical deep detector, we propose two novel modules: 1) by modeling the semantic interactions between channels and the long-range dependencies between spatial positions, the self-attending module generates both channel and position attention, and enhance the original convolutional features in a self-guided manner; 2) leveraging the class-discriminative localization ability of classification-trained CNN, the semantic activating module learns a semantic meaningful convolutional response which augments low-level convolutional features with strong class-specific semantic information. The so called self-attending and semantic activating network (ASAN) achieves better accuracy than two-stage methods and is able to fulfil real-time processing. Comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC indicates that ASAN achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with high efficiency.

AB A Service Function Chain (SFC) is an ordered sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs) to provide network service. Most existing SFC orchestration schemes, however, cannot optimize the resources allocation while guaranteeing the service delay constraint. To fulfill this goal, we propose a Layered Graph based SFC Orchestration Scheme (LGOS). LGOS converts both the cost of resource and the related delay into the link weights in the layered graph, which helps abstract the SFC orchestration problem as a shortest path problem. Then a simulated annealing based batch processing algorithm is designed for SFC requests set. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that our scheme can reduce the end-to-end delay and the operational expenditure by 21.6% and 13.7% at least, and the acceptance ratio of requests set can be improved by 22.3%, compared with other algorithms.

DT Review
DE modern code review; review comments; mining software repositories;
   empirical study; machine learning
AB Modern code review is a well-known practice to assess the quality of software where developers discuss the quality in a web-based review tool. However, this lightweight approach may risk an inefficient review participation, especially when comments becomes either excessive (i.e., too many) or underwhelming (i.e., too few). In this study, we investigate the phenomena of reviewer commenting. Through a large-scale empirical analysis of over 1.1 million reviews from five OSS systems, we conduct an exploratory study to investigate the frequency, size, and evolution of reviewer commenting. Moreover, we also conduct a modeling study to understand the most important features that potentially drive reviewer comments. Our results find that (i) the number of comments and the number of words in the comments tend to vary among reviews and across studied systems; (ii) reviewers change their behaviours in commenting over time; and (iii) human experience and patch property aspects impact the number of comments and the number of words in the comments.

AB SPHINCS+, an updated version of SPHINCS, is a post-quantum hash-based signature scheme submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization project. To evaluate its performance, SPHINCS+ gives the theoretical number of function calls and the actual runtime of a reference implementation. We show that the theoretical number of function calls for SPHINCS+ verification is inconsistent with the runtime and then present the correct number of function calls.

   reducing the number of model parameters
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNS) have a strong ability to understand and judge images. However, the enormous parameters and computation of CNNS have limited its application in resource-limited devices. In this letter, we used the idea of parameter sharing and dense connection to compress the parameters in the convolution kernel channel direction, thus greatly reducing the number of model parameters. On this basis, we designed Shared and Dense Channel-wise Convolutional Networks (SDChannelNets), mainly composed of Depth-wise Separable SD-Channel-wise Convolution layer. The advantage of SDChannelNets is that the number of model parameters is greatly reduced without or with little loss of accuracy. We also introduced a hyperparameter that can effectively balance the number of parameters and the accuracy of a model. We evaluated the model proposed by us through two popular image recognition tasks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). The results showed that SDChannelNets had similar accuracy to other CNNs, but the number of parameters was greatly reduced.

AB Deterioration of software quality developed by multiple organizations has become a serious problem. To predict software degradation after an organizational change, this paper investigates the influence of quality deterioration on software metrics by analyzing three software projects. To detect factors indicating a low evolvability, we focus on the relationships between the change in software metric values and refactoring tendencies. Refactoring after an organization change impacts the quality.

TI Graph Similarity Metric Using Graph Convolutional Network: Application

AB Nowadays, malware is a serious threat to the Internet. Traditional signature-based malware detection method can be easily evaded by code obfuscation. Therefore, many researchers use the high-level structure of malware like function call graph, which is impacted less from the obfuscation, to find the malware variants. However, existing graph match methods rely on approximate calculation, which are inefficient and the accuracy cannot be effectively guaranteed. Inspired by the successful application of graph convolutional network in node classification and graph classification, we propose a novel malware similarity metric method based on graph convolutional network. We use graph convolutional network to compute the graph embedding vectors, and then we calculate the similarity metric of two graph based on the distance between two graph embedding vectors. Experimental results on the Kaggle dataset show that our method can applied to the graph based malware similarity metric method, and the accuracy of clustering application with our method reaches to 97% with high time efficiency.

AB The large computational complexity makes stereo matching a big challenge in real-time application scenario. The problem of stereo matching in a video sequence is slightly different with that in a still image because there exists temporal correlation among video frames. However, no existing method considered temporal consistency of disparity for algorithm acceleration. In this work, we proposed a scheme called the dynamic disparity range (DDR) to optimize matching cost calculation and cost aggregation steps by narrowing disparity searching range, and a scheme called temporal cost aggregation path to optimize the cost aggregation step. Based on the schemes, we proposed the DDR-SGM and the DDR-MCCNN algorithms for the stereo matching in video sequences. Evaluation results showed that the proposed algorithms significantly reduced the computational complexity with only very slight loss of accuracy. We proved that the proposed optimizations for the stereo matching are effective and the temporal consistency in stereo video is highly useful for either improving accuracy or reducing computational complexity.

AB This paper introduces e-spill, an eager spill mechanism, which dynamically finds the optimal spill-threshold by monitoring the GC time at runtime and thereby prevent expensive GC overhead. Our e-spill adopts a slow-start model to gradually increase the spill-threshold until it reaches the optimal point without substantial GCs. We prototype e-spill as an extension to Spark and evaluate it using six workloads on three different parallel platforms. Our evaluations show that e-spill improves performance by up to 3.80x and saves the cost of cluster operation on Amazon EC2 cloud by up to 51% over the baseline system following Spark Tuning Guidelines.

AB Recently, multi-view dictionary learning technique has attracted lots of research interest. Although several multi-view dictionary learning methods have been addressed, they can be further improved. Most of existing multi-view dictionary learning methods adopt the l(0) or l(1)-norm sparsity constraint on the representation coefficients, which makes the training and testing phases time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view dictionary learning approach named multi-view synthesis and analysis dictionaries learning (MSADL), which jointly learns multiple discriminant dictionary pairs with each corresponding to one view and containing a structured synthesis dictionary and a structured analysis dictionary. MSADL utilizes synthesis dictionaries to achieve class-specific reconstruction and uses analysis dictionaries to generate discriminative code coefficients by linear projection. Furthermore, we design an uncorrelation term for multi-view dictionary learning, such that the redundancy among synthesis dictionaries learned from different views can be reduced. Two widely used datasets are employed as test data. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Highly Efficient Mobile Visual Search Algorithm

DE mobile visual search; descriptor extraction; feature selection;

AB In this paper, we propose a highly efficient mobile visual search algorithm. For descriptor extraction process, we propose a low complexity feature detection which utilizes the detected local key points of the coarse octaves to guide the scale space construction and feature detection in the fine octave. The Gaussian and Laplacian operations are skipped for the unimportant area, and thus the computing time is saved. Besides, feature selection is placed before orientation computing to further reduce the complexity of feature detection by pre-discarding some unimportant local points. For the image retrieval process, we design a high-performance reranking method, which merges both the global descriptor matching score and the local descriptor similarity score (LDSS). In the calculating of LDSS, the tf-idf weighted histogram matching is performed to integrate the statistical information of the database. The results show that the proposed highly efficient approach achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art for mobile visual search, while the descriptor extraction complexity is largely reduced.

TI Model Inversion Attacks for Online Prediction Systems: Without Knowledge
   of Non-Sensitive Attributes
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE black box; model inversion; data poisoning; online ML systems
AB The number of IT services that use machine learning (ML) algorithms are continuously and rapidly growing, while many of them are used in practice to make some type of predictions from personal data. Not surprisingly, due to this sudden boom in ML, the way personal data are handled in ML systems are starting to raise serious privacy concerns that were previously unconsidered. Recently, Fredrikson et al. [USENIX 2014] [CCS 2015] proposed a novel attack against ML systems called the model inversion attack that aims to infer sensitive attribute values of a target user. In their work, for the model inversion attack to be successful, the adversary is required to obtain two types of information concerning the target user prior to the attack: the output value (i.e., prediction) of the ML system and all of the non-sensitive values used to learn the output. Therefore, although the attack does raise new privacy concerns, since the adversary is required to know all of the non-sensitive values in advance, it is not completely clear how much risk is incurred by the attack. In particular, even though the users may regard these values as non-sensitive, it may be difficult for the adversary to obtain all of the non-sensitive attribute values prior to the attack, hence making the attack invalid. The goal of this paper is to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks in the case when non-sensitive attributes of a target user are not available to the adversary. To this end, we first propose a general model inversion (GMI) framework, which models the amount of auxiliary information available to the adversary. Our framework captures the model inversion attack of Fredrikson et al. as a special case, while also capturing model inversion attacks that infer sensitive attributes without the knowledge of non-sensitive attributes. For the latter attack, we provide a general methodology on how we can infer sensitive attributes of a target user without knowledge of non-sensitive attributes. At a high level, we use the data poisoning paradigm in a conceptually novel way and inject malicious data into the ML system in order to modify the internal ML model being used into a target ML model; a special type of ML model which allows one to perform model inversion attacks without the knowledge of non-sensitive attributes. Finally, following our general methodology, we cast ML systems that internally use linear regression models into our GMI framework and propose a concrete algorithm for model inversion attacks that does not require knowledge of the non-sensitive attributes. We show the effectiveness of our model inversion attack through experimental evaluation using two real data sets.

AB Nowadays, open source software (OSS) systems are adopted by proprietary software projects. To reduce the risk of using problematic OSS systems (e.g., causing system crashes), it is important for proprietary software projects to assess OSS systems in advance. Therefore, OSS quality assessment models are studied to obtain information regarding the quality of OSS systems. Although the OSS quality assessment models are partially validated using a small number of case studies, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies that empirically report how industrial projects actually use OSS quality assessment models in their own development process. In this study, we empirically evaluate the cost and effectiveness of OSS quality assessment models at Fujitsu Kyushu Network Technologies Limited (Fujitsu QNET). To conduct the empirical study, we collect datasets from (a) 120 OSS projects that Fujitsu QNET's projects actually used and (b) 10 problematic OSS projects that caused major problems in the projects. We find that (1) it takes average and median times of 51 and 49 minutes, respectively, to gather all assessment metrics per OSS project and (2) there is a possibility that we can filter problematic OSS systems by using the threshold derived from a pool of assessment metrics. Fujitsu QNET's developers agree that our results lead to improvements in Fujitsu QNET's OSS assessment process. We believe that our work significantly contributes to the empirical knowledge about applying OSS assessment techniques to industrial projects.

TI Sparse Graph Based Deep Learning Networks for Face Recognition
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article

AB In recent years, deep learning based approaches have substantially improved the performance of face recognition. Most existing deep learning techniques work well, but neglect effective utilization of face correlation information. The resulting performance loss is noteworthy for personal appearance variations caused by factors such as illumination, pose, occlusion, and misalignment. We believe that face correlation information should be introduced to solve this network performance problem originating from by intra-personal variations. Recently, graph deep learning approaches have emerged for representing structured graph data. A graph is a powerful tool for representing complex information of the face image. In this paper, we survey the recent research related to the graph structure of Convolutional Neural Networks and try to devise a definition of graph structure included in Compressed Sensing and Deep Learning. This paper devoted to the story explain of two properties of our graph - sparse and depth. Sparse can be advantageous since features are more likely to be linearly separable and they are more robust. The depth means that this is a multi-resolution multi-channel learning process. We think that sparse graph based deep neural network can more effectively make similar objects to attract each other, the relative, different objects mutually exclusive, similar to a better sparse multi-resolution clustering. Based on this concept, we propose a sparse graph representation based on the face correlation information that is embedded via the sparse reconstruction and deep learning within an irregular domain. The resulting classification is remarkably robust. The proposed method achieves high recognition rates of 99.61% (94.67%) on the benchmark LFW (YTF) facial evaluation database.

AB This study proposes a mathematical model of a gesture-based pointing interface system for simulating pointing behaviors in various situations. We assume an interaction between a pointing interface and a user as a human-in-the-loop system and describe it using feedback control theory. The model is formulated as a hybrid of a target value follow-up component and a disturbance compensation one. These are induced from the same feedback loop but with different parameter sets to describe human pointing characteristics well. The two optimal parameter sets were determined individually to represent actual pointing behaviors accurately for step input signals and random walk disturbance sequences, respectively. The calibrated model is used to simulate pointing behaviors for arbitrary input signals expected in practical situations. Through experimental evaluations, we quantitatively analyzed the performance of the proposed hybrid model regarding how accurately it can simulate actual pointing behaviors and also discuss the advantage regarding the basic non-hybrid model. Model refinements for further accuracy are also suggested based on the evaluation results.

AB In this paper, we study parallel join processing to improve the performance of the merge phase of sort-merge join by integrating all parallelism provided by mainstream CPUs. Modern CPUs support SIMD instruction sets with wider SIMD registers which allows to process multiple data items per each instruction. Thus, we devise an efficient parallel join algorithm, called Parallel Merge Join with SIMD instructions (PMJS). In our proposed algorithm, we utilize data parallelism by exploiting SIMD instructions. And we also accelerate the performance by avoiding the usage of conditional branch instructions. Furthermore, to take advantage of the multiple cores, our proposed algorithm is threaded in multi-thread environments. In our multi-thread algorithm, to distribute workload evenly to each thread, we devise an efficient workload balancing algorithm based on the kernel density estimator which allows to estimate the workload of each thread accurately.

AB Rough set theory is an important branch of data mining and granular computing, among which neighborhood rough set is presented to deal with numerical data and hybrid data. In this paper, we propose a new concept called inconsistent neighborhood, which extracts inconsistent objects from a traditional neighborhood. Firstly, a series of interesting properties are obtained for inconsistent neighborhoods. Specially, some properties generate new solutions to compute the quantities in neighborhood rough set. Then, a fast forward attribute reduction algorithm is proposed by applying the obtained properties. Experiments undertaken on twelve UCI datasets show that the proposed algorithm can get the same attribute reduction results as the existing algorithms in neighborhood rough set domain, and it runs much faster than the existing ones. This validates that employing inconsistent neighborhoods is advantageous in the applications of neighborhood rough set. The study would provide a new insight into neighborhood rough set theory.

AB This letter presents a novel tensor voting mechanism analytic tensor voting (ATV), to get rid of the difficulties in original tensor voting, especially the efficiency. One of the main advantages is its explicit voting formulations, which benefit the completion of tensor voting theory and computational efficiency. Firstly, new decaying function was designed following the basic spirit of decaying function in original tensor voting (OTV). Secondly, analytic stick tensor voting (ASTV) was formulated using the new decaying function. Thirdly, analytic plate and ball tensor voting (APTV, ABTV) were formulated through controllable stick tensor construction and tensorial integration. These make the each voting of tensor can be computed by several non-iterative matrix operations, improving the efficiency of tensor voting remarkably. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of proposed method.

DE query autocompletion; spatial databases; top-k queries
AB Query autocompletion is an important and practical technique when users want to search for desirable information. As mobile devices become more and more popular, one of the main applications is location-aware service, such as Web mapping. In this paper, we propose a new solution to location-aware query autocompletion. We devise a trie-based index structure and integrate spatial information into trie nodes. Our method is able to answer both range and top-k queries. In addition, we discuss the extension of our method to support the error tolerant feature in case user's queries contain typographical errors. Experiments on real datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of query processing performance.

AB The ability to efficiently process exponentially increasing data remains a challenging issue for computer platforms. In legacy computing platforms, large amounts of data can cause performance bottlenecks at the I/O interfaces between CPUs and storage devices. To overcome this problem, the in-storage computing (ISC) technique is introduced, which offloads some of the computations from the CPUs to the storage devices. In this paper, we propose DiSC, a distributed in-storage computing platform using cost-effective hardware. First, we designed a general-purpose ISC device, a so-called DiSC endpoint, by combining an inexpensive single-board computer (SBC) and a hard disk. Second, aMesos-based resource manager is adapted into the DiSC platform to schedule the DiSC endpoint tasks. To draw comparisons to a general CPU-based platform, a DiSC testbed is constructed and experiments are carried out using essential applications. The experimental results show that DiSC attains cost-efficient performance advantages over a desktop, particularly for searching and filtering workloads.

ID REDUCING VISUAL DISCOMFORT
AB The quality of visual comfort and depth perception is a crucial requirement for virtual reality (VR) applications. This paper investigates major causes of visual discomfort and proposes a novel virtual camera controlling method using visual saliency to minimize visual discomfort. We extract the saliency of each scene and properly adjust the convergence plane to preserve realistic 3D effects. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our method on free-form architecture models. The results indicate that the proposed saliency-guided camera control is more comfortable than typical camera control and gives more realistic depth perception.

AB The use of flash memory based storage devices is rapidly increasing, and user demands for high performance are also constantly increasing. The performance of the flash storage device is greatly influenced by cleaning operations of Flash Translation Layer (FTL). Various studies have been conducted to lower the cost of cleaning operations. However, there are limits to achieve sufficient performance improvement of flash storages without help of a host system, with only limited information in storage devices. Recently, SCSI, eMMC, and UFS standards provide an interface for sending semantic information from a host system to a storage device. In this paper, we analyze effects of semantic information on performance and lifetime of flash storage devices. We evaluate performance and lifetime improvement through SA-FTL (Semantic Aware Flash Translation Layer), which can take advantage of semantic information in storage devices. Experiments show that SA-FTL improves performance and lifetime of flash based storages by up to 30 and 35%, respectively, compared to a simple page-level FTL.

ID EM
AB With the huge influx of various data nowadays, extracting knowledge from them has become an interesting but tedious task among data scientists, particularly when the data come in heterogeneous form and have missing information. Many data completion techniques had been introduced, especially in the advent of kernel methods-a way in which one can represent heterogeneous data sets into a single form: as kernel matrices. However, among the many data completion techniques available in the literature, studies about mutually completing several incomplete kernel matrices have not been given much attention yet. In this paper, we present a new method, called Mutual Kernel Matrix Completion (MKMC) algorithm, that tackles this problem of mutually inferring the missing entries of multiple kernel matrices by combining the notions of data fusion and kernel matrix completion, applied on biological data sets to be used for classification task. We first introduced an objective function that will be minimized by exploiting the EM algorithm, which in turn results to an estimate of the missing entries of the kernel matrices involved. The completed kernel matrices are then combined to produce a model matrix that can be used to further improve the obtained estimates. An interesting result of our study is that the E-step and the M-step are given in closed form, which makes our algorithm efficient in terms of time and memory. After completion, the ( completed) kernel matrices are then used to train an SVM classifier to test how well the relationships among the entries are preserved. Our empirical results show that the proposed algorithm bested the traditional completion techniques in preserving the relationships among the data points, and in accurately recovering the missing kernel matrix entries. By far, MKMC offers a promising solution to the problem of mutual estimation of a number of relevant incomplete kernel matrices.

AB An online nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm based on recursive least squares (RLS) is described in a matrix form, and a simplified algorithm for a low-complexity calculation is developed for frame-by-frame online audio source separation system. First, the online NMF algorithm based on the RLS method is described as solving the NMF problem recursively. Next, a simplified algorithm is developed to approximate the RLS-based online NMF algorithm with low complexity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of audio source separation, and the results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms are superior to that of the conventional online NMF algorithm with significantly reduced complexity.

AB In this paper, we propose the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to scale-spaces. PCA is a standard method used in computer vision. Because the translation of an input image into scale-space is a continuous operation, it requires the extension of conventional finite matrix-based PCA to an infinite number of dimensions. Here, we use spectral theory to resolve this infinite eigenvalue problem through the use of integration, and we propose an approximate solution based on polynomial equations. In order to clarify its eigensolutions, we apply spectral decomposition to Gaussian scale-space and scale-normalized Laplacian of Gaussian (sLoG) space. As an application of this proposed method, we introduce a method for generating Gaussian blur images and sLoG images, demonstrating that the accuracy of such an image can be made very high by using an arbitrary scale calculated through simple linear combination. Furthermore, to make the scale-space filtering efficient, we approximate the basis filter set using Gaussian lobes approximation and we can obtain XY-Separable filters. As a more practical example, we propose a new Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) detector.

AB Narrow swipe sensor based systems have drawn more and more attention in recent years. However, the size of captured image is significantly smaller than that obtained from the traditional area fingerprint sensor. Under this condition the available minutiae number is also limited. Therefore, only employing minutiae with the standard associated feature can hardly achieve high verification accuracy. To solve this problem, we present a novel Hybrid Minutiae Descriptor (HMD) which consists of two modules. The first one: Minutiae Ridge-Valley Orientation Descriptor captures the orientation information around minutia and also the trace points located at associated ridge and valley. The second one: Gabor Binary Code extracts and codes the image patch around minutiae. The proposed HMD enhances the representation capability of minutiae feature, and can be matched very efficiently. Experiments conducted over public databases and the database captured by the narrow swipe sensor show that this innovative method gives rise to significant improvements in reducing FRR (False Reject Rate) and EER (Equal Error Rate).

AB A text-dependent i-vector extraction scheme and a lexicon-based binary vector (L-vector) representation are proposed to improve the performance of text-dependent speaker verification. I-vector and L-vector are used to represent the utterances for enrollment and test. An improved cosine distance kernel is constructed by combining i-vector and L-vector together and is used to distinguish both speaker identity and lexical (or text) diversity with back-end support vector machine (SVM). Experiments are conducted on RSR 2015 Corpus part 1 and part 2, the results indicate that at most 30% improvement can be obtained compared with traditional i-vector baseline.

AB In this paper, we present an FPGA hardware implementation for a phylogenetic tree reconstruction with a maximum parsimony algorithm. We base our approach on a particular stochastic local search algorithm that uses the Progressive Neighborhood and the Indirect Calculation of Tree Lengths method. This method is widely used for the acceleration of the phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithm in software. In our implementation, we define a tree structure and accelerate the search by parallel and pipeline processing. We show results for eight real-world biological datasets. We compare execution times against our previous hardware approach, and TNT, the fastest available parsimony program, which is also accelerated by the Indirect Calculation of Tree Lengths method. Acceleration rates between 34 to 45 per rearrangement, and 2 to 6 for the whole search, are obtained against our previous hardware approach. Acceleration rates between 2 to 36 per rearrangement, and 18 to 112 for the whole search, are obtained against TNT.

TI Face Hallucination by Learning Local Distance Metric
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE face hallucination; face super-resolution; metric learning
AB In this letter, we propose a novel method for face hallucination by learning a new distance metric in the low-resolution (LR) patch space (source space). Local patch-based face hallucination methods usually assume that the two manifolds formed by LR and high-resolution (HR) image patches have similar local geometry. However, this assumption does not hold well in practice. Motivated by metric learning in machine learning, we propose to learn a new distance metric in the source space, under the supervision of the true local geometry in the target space (HR patch space). The learned new metric gives more freedom to the presentation of local geometry in the source space, and thus the local geometries of source and target space turn to be more consistent. Experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the- art face hallucination and image super-resolution (SR) methods.

AB Packages are re-usable components for faster and effective software maintenance. To promote the re-use in object-oriented systems and maintenance tasks easier, packages should be organized to depict compact design. Therefore, understanding and assessing package organization is primordial for maintenance tasks like Re-usability and Changeability. We believe that additional investigations of prevalent basic design principles such as defined by R.C. Martin are required to explore different aspects of package organization. In this study, we propose package-organization framework based on reachable components that measures re-usability index. Package re-usability index measures common effect of change taking place over dependent elements of a package in an object-oriented design paradigm. A detailed quality assessment on different versions of open source software systems is presented which evaluates capability of the proposed package re-usability index and other traditional package-level metrics to predict fault-proneness in software. The experimental study shows that proposed index captures different aspects of package-design which can be practically integrated with best practices of software development. Furthermore, the results provide insights on organization of feasible software design to counter potential faults appearing due to complex package dependencies.

AB In this paper, we present a GPU implementation of bulk multiple-length multiplications. The idea of our GPU implementation is to adopt a warp-synchronous programming technique. We assign each multiple-length multiplication to one warp that consists of 32 threads. In parallel processing using multiple threads, usually, it is costly to synchronize execution of threads and communicate within threads. In warpsynchronous programming technique, however, execution of threads in a warp can be synchronized instruction by instruction without any barrier synchronous operations. Also, inter-thread communication can be performed by warp shuffle functions without accessing shared memory. The experimental results show that our GPU implementation on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 attains a speed-up factor of 52 for 1024-bit multiple-length multiplication over the sequential CPU implementation. Moreover, we use this 1024-bit multiple-length multiplication for larger size of bits as a sub-routine. The GPU implementation attains a speed-up factor of 21 for 65536-bit multiple-length multiplication.

AB The closeness of a match is an important measure with a number of practical applications, including computational biology, signal processing and text retrieval. The approximate string matching (ASM) problem asks to find a substring of string Y of length n that is most similar to string X of length m. It is well-know that the ASM can be solved by dynamic programming technique by computing a table of size m x n. The main contribution of this work is to present a memory-access-efficient implementation for computing the ASM on a GPU. The proposed GPU implementation relies on warp shuffle instructions which are used to accelerate the communication between threads without resorting to shared memory access. Despite the fact that O(mn) memory access operations are necessary to access all elements of a table with size n x m, the proposed implementation performs only O(mn w) memory access operations, where w is the warp size. Experimental results carried out on a GeForce GTX 980 GPU show that the proposed implementation, called w-SCAN, provides speed-up of over two fold in computing the ASM as compared to another prominent alternative.

TI Policy Optimization for Spoken Dialog Management Using Genetic Algorithm
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE spoken dialog management; spoken dialog system; genetic algorithm
AB The optimization of spoken dialog management policies is a non-trivial task due to the erroneous inputs from speech recognition and language understanding modules. The dialog manager needs to ground uncertain semantic information at times to fully understand the need of human users and successfully complete the required dialog tasks. Approaches based on reinforcement learning are currently mainstream in academia and have been proved to be effective, especially when operating in noisy environments. However, in reinforcement learning the dialog strategy is often represented by complex numeric model and thus is incomprehensible to humans. The trained policies are very difficult for dialog system designers to verify or modify, which largely limits the deployment for commercial applications. In this paper we propose a novel framework for optimizing dialog policies specified in human-readable domain language using genetic algorithm. We present learning algorithms using user simulator and real human-machine dialog corpora. Empirical experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve competitive performance on par with some state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, while maintaining a comprehensible policy structure.

AB In practice, emotional speech utterances are often collected from different devices or conditions, which will lead to discrepancy between the training and testing data, resulting in sharp decrease of recognition rates. To solve this problem, in this letter, a novel transfer semisupervised non-negative matrix factorization (TSNMF) method is presented. A semi-supervised negative matrix factorization algorithm, utilizing both labeled source and unlabeled target data, is adopted to learn common feature representations. Meanwhile, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a similarity measurement is employed to reduce the distance between the feature distributions of two databases. Finally, the TSNMF algorithm, which optimizes the SNMF and MMD functions together, is proposed to obtain robust feature representations across databases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed method can significantly improve the cross-corpus recognition rates.

AB We reported a secure scan design approach using shift register equivalents (SR-equivalents, for short) that are functionally equivalent but not structurally equivalent to shift registers [10] and also introduced generalized shift registers (GSRs, for short) to apply them to secure scan design [11]-[ 13]. In this paper, we combine both concepts of SR-equivalents and GSRs and consider the synthesis problem of SR-equivalent GSRs, i.e., how to modify a given GSR to an SR-equivalent GSR. We also consider the enumeration problem of SR-equivalent GFSRs, i.e., the cardinality of the class of SR-equivalent GSRs to clarify the security level of the secure scan architecture.

AB The reputation-based majority-voting approach is a promising solution for detecting malicious workers in a cloud system. However, this approach has a drawback in that it can detect malicious workers only when the number of colluders make up no more than half of all workers. In this paper, we simulate the behavior of a reputation-based method and mathematically analyze its accuracy. Through the analysis, we observe that, regardless of the number of colluders and their collusion probability, if the reputation value of a group is significantly different from those of other groups, it is a completely honest group. Based on the analysis result, we propose a new method for distinguishing honest workers from colluders even when the colluders make up the majority group. The proposed method constructs groups based on their reputations. A group with the significantly highest or lowest reputation value is considered a completely honest group. Otherwise, honest workers are mixed together with colluders in a group. The proposed method accurately identifies honest workers even in a mixed group by comparing each voting result one by one. The results of a security analysis and an experiment show that our method can identify honest workers much more accurately than a traditional reputation-based approach with little additional computational overhead.

AB Designing secure revocable storage systems for a large number of users in a cloud-based environment is important. Cloud storage systems should allow its users to dynamically join and leave the storage service. Further, the rights of the users to access the data should be changed accordingly. Recently, Liang et al. proposed a cloud-based revocable identity-based proxy re-encryption (CR-IB-PRE) scheme that supports user revocation and delegation of decryption rights. Moreover, to reduce the size of the key update token, they employed a public key broadcast encryption system as a building block. In this paper, we show that the CR-IB-PRE scheme with the reduced key update token size is not secure against collusion attacks.
