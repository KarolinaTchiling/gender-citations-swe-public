AB In this note, we consider the problem of finding a stepby-step transformation between two longest increasing subsequences in a sequence, namely LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE RECONFIGURATION. We give a polynomial -time algorithm for deciding whether there is a reconfiguration sequence between two longest increasing subsequences in a sequence. This implies that INDEPENDENT SET RECONFIGURATION and TOKEN SLIDING are polynomial -time solvable on permutation graphs, provided that the input two independent sets are largest among all independent sets in the input graph. We also consider a special case, where the underlying permutation graph of an input sequence is bipartite. In this case, we give a polynomial -time algorithm for finding a shortest reconfiguration sequence (if it exists).

ID OUTSOURCED DATABASE
AB Cloud computing has become the mainstream computing paradigm nowadays. More and more data owners (DO) choose to outsource their data to a cloud service provider (CSP), who is responsible for data management and query processing on behalf of DO, so as to cut down operational costs for the DO. However, in real -world applications, CSP may be untrusted, hence it is necessary to authenticate the query result returned from the CSP. In this paper, we consider the problem of approximate string query result authentication in the context of database outsourcing. Based on Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) and Trie, we propose an authenticated tree structure named MTrie for authenticating approximate string query results. We design efficient algorithms for query processing and query result authentication. To verify effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on real datasets and the results show that our proposed method can effectively authenticate approximate string query results.

AB This paper proposes a novel application of coded apertures (CAs) for visual information hiding. CA is one of the representative computational photography techniques, in which a patterned mask is attached to a camera as an alternative to a conventional circular aperture. With image processing in the post-processing phase, various functions such as omnifocal image capturing and depth estimation can be performed. In general, a watermark embedded as high-frequency components is difficult to extract if captured outside the focal length, and defocus blur occurs. Installation of a CA into the camera is a simple solution to mitigate the difficulty, and several attempts are conducted to make a better design for stable extraction. On the contrary, our motivation is to design a specific CA as well as an information hiding scheme; the secret information can only be decoded if an image with hidden information is captured with the key aperture at a certain distance outside the focus range. The proposed technique designs the key aperture patterns and information hiding scheme through evolutionary multi-objective optimization so as to minimize the decryption error of a hidden image when using the key aperture while minimizing the accuracy when using other apertures. During the optimization process, solution candidates, i.e., key aperture patterns and information hiding schemes, are evaluated on actual devices to account for disturbances that cannot be considered in optical simulations. Experimental results have shown that decoding can be performed with the designed key aperture and similar ones, that decrypted image quality deteriorates as the similarity between the key and the aperture used for decryption decreases, and that the proposed information hiding technique works on actual devices.

ID REGRESSION
AB In this paper, we explore privacy-preserving techniques in federated learning, including those can be used with both neural networks and decision trees. We begin by identifying how information can be leaked in federated learning, after which we present methods to address this issue by introducing two privacy-preserving frameworks that encompass many existing privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) systems. Through experiments with publicly available financial, medical, and Internet of Things datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy-preserving federated learning and its potential to develop highly accurate, secure, and privacy-preserving machine learning systems in real-world scenarios. The findings highlight the importance of considering privacy in the design and implementation of federated learning systems and suggest that privacypreserving techniques are essential in enabling the development of effective and practical machine learning systems.

AB In the software testing phase, software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are commonly used to evaluate the reliability of software systems. Traditional SRGMs are restricted by their assumption of a continuous growth pattern for the failure detection rate (FDR) throughout the testing phase. However, the assumption is compromised by Change-Point phenomena, where FDR fluctuations stem from variations in testing personnel or procedural modifications, leading to reduced prediction accuracy and compromised software reliability assessments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to improve software reliability prediction using a novel approach that combines genetic algorithm (GA) and deep learning-based SRGMs to account for the Change-point phenomenon. The proposed approach uses a GA to dynamically combine activation functions from various deep learning-based SRGMs into a new mutated SRGM called MuSRGM. The MuSRGM captures the advantages of both concave and S-shaped SRGMs and is better suited to capture the change-point phenomenon during testing and more accurately reflect actual testing situations. Additionally, failure data is treated as a time series and analyzed using a combination of Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) and Attention mechanisms. To assess the performance of MuSRGM, we conducted experiments on three distinct failure datasets. The results indicate that MuSRGM outperformed the baseline method, exhibiting low prediction error (MSE) on all three datasets. Furthermore, MuSRGM demonstrated remarkable generalization ability on these datasets, remaining unaffected by uneven data distribution. Therefore, MuSRGM represents a highly promising advanced solution that can provide increased accuracy and applicability for software reliability assessment during the testing phase.

AB Despite recent advancements in utilizing meta -learning for addressing the generalization challenges of graph neural networks (GNN), their performance in argumentation mining tasks, such as argument classifications, remains relatively limited. This is primarily due to the underutilization of potential pattern knowledge intrinsic to argumentation structures. To address this issue, our study proposes a two -stage, pattern -based meta-GNN method in contrast to conventional pattern -free meta-GNN approaches. Initially, our method focuses on learning a high-level pattern representation to effectively capture the pattern knowledge within an argumentation structure and then predicts edge types. It then utilizes a metalearning framework in the second stage, designed to train a meta -learner based on the predicted edge types. This feature allows for rapid generalization to novel argumentation graphs. Through experiments on real English discussion datasets spanning diverse topics, our results demonstrate that our proposed method substantially outperforms conventional pattern -free GNN approaches, signifying a significant stride forward in this domain.

AB In recent years, the increasing complexity of deep network structures has hindered their application in small resource constrained hardware. Therefore, we urgently need to compress and accelerate deep network models. Channel pruning is an effective method to compress deep neural networks. However, most existing channel pruning methods are prone to falling into local optima. In this paper, we propose a channel pruning method via Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer Pruner which called IGWOPruner to prune redundant channels of convolutional neural networks. It identifies pruning ratio of each layer by using Improved Grey Wolf algorithm, and then fine-tuning the new pruned network model. In experimental section, we evaluate the proposed method in CIFAR datasets and ILSVRC2012 with several classical networks, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet-18/34/56/152, and experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is able to prune a large number of redundant channels and parameters with rare performance loss.

ID FUSION
AB Highly conflicting evidence that may lead to the counterintuitive results is one of the challenges for information fusion in DempsterShafer evidence theory. To deal with this issue, evidence conflict is investigated based on belief divergence measuring the discrepancy between evidence. In this paper, the pignistic probability transform belief x 2 divergence, named as BB chi 2 divergence, is proposed. By introducing the pignistic probability transform, the proposed BB chi 2 divergence can accurately quantify the difference between evidence with the consideration of multi -element sets. Compared with a few belief divergences, the novel divergence has more precision. Based on this advantageous divergence, a new multi -source information fusion method is devised. The proposed method considers both credibility weights and information volume weights to determine the overall weight of each evidence. Eventually, the proposed method is applied in target recognition and fault diagnosis, in which comparative analysis indicates that the proposed method can realize the highest accuracy for managing evidence conflict.

AB In this paper we study a recently proposed variant of the problem the r-gathering problem. An r-gathering of customers C to facilities F is an assignment A of C to open facilities F 'subset of F such that r or more customers are assigned to each open facility. (Each open facility needs enough number of customers.) Then the cost of an r-gathering is max{max (c is an element of C){co(c,A(c))},max f is an element of F '{op(f)}}, and the r-gathering problem finds an r-gathering having the minimum cost. Assume that F is a set of locations for emergency shelters, op(f) is the time needed to prepare a shelter f is an element of F, and co(c, f) is the time needed for a person c is an element of C to reach assigned shelter f = A(c) is an element of F. Then an r-gathering corresponds to an evacuation plan such that each opened shelter serves r or more people, and the r-gathering problem finds an evacuttion plan minimizing the evacuation time span. However in a solution above some person may be assigned to a farther open shelter although it has some closer open shelter. It may be difficult for the person to accept such an assignment for an emergency situation. Therefore Armon considered the problem with one more additional constraint, that is, each customer should be assigned to a closest open facility, and gave a 9-approximation algorithm for the problem. We have designed a simple3-approximation algorithm for the problem. The running time is O(r | C|| F).

We applied it to file system operations of a secure container runtime, gVisor. We found that gVisor's operations can become more expensive than the native by 48x more syscalls for open, and 6x for read and write.

   adaptive denormalization; double-tail
AB Photo animation is to transform photos of real-world scenes into anime style images, which is a challenging task in AIGC (AI Generated Content). Although previous methods have achieved promising results, they often introduce noticeable artifacts or distortions. In this paper, we propose a novel double-tail generative adversarial network (DTGAN) for fast photo animation. DTGAN is the third version of the AnimeGAN series. Therefore, DTGAN is also called AnimeGANv3. The generator of DTGAN has two output tails, a support tail for outputting coarse-grained anime style images and a main tail for refining coarse-grained anime style images. In DTGAN, we propose a novel learnable normalization technique, termed as linearly adaptive denormalization (LADE), to prevent artifacts in the generated images. In order to improve the visual quality of the generated anime style images, two novel loss functions suitable for photo animation are proposed: 1) the region smoothing loss function, which is used to weaken the texture details of the generated images to achieve anime effects with abstract details; 2) the fine-grained revision loss function, which is used to eliminate artifacts and noise in the generated anime style image while preserving clear edges. Furthermore, the generator of DTGAN is a lightweight generator framework with only 1.02 million parameters in the inference phase. The proposed DTGAN can be easily end-to-end trained with unpaired training data. Extensive experiments have been conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality anime style images from real-world photos and perform better than the state-of-the-art models.

According to our video analysis and interviews, choreographers typically need to imagine dancers' movements to revise drafts on paper since testing new movements and formations with actual dancers takes time. To address this difficulty, we present an interactive group -dance simulation interface, DanceUnisoner , that assists choreographers in composing a group dance in a simulated environment. With DanceUnisoner, choreographers can arrange excerpts from solo -dance videos of dancers throughout a three-dimensional space. They can adjust various parameters related to the dancers in real time, such as each dancer's position and size and each movement's timing. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system's parametric, visual, and interactive interface, we asked seven choreographers to use it and compose group dances. Our observations, interviews, and quantitative analysis revealed their successful usage in iterative refinements and visual checking of choreography, providing insights to facilitate further computational creativity support for choreographers.

AB Real-time matting is a challenging research in deep learning. Conventional CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) approaches are easy to misjudge the foreground and background semantic and have blurry matting edges, which result from CNN's limited concentration on global context due to receptive field. We propose a real-time matting approach former structure, attention and content-aware guidance to solve issues above. The semantic accuracy improves a lot due to the establishment of global context and long-range pixel information. The experiments show our approach exceeds a 30% reduction in error metrics compared with existing real-time matting approaches.

TI PSDSpell: Pre-Training with Self-Distillation Learning for Chinese
   Spelling Correction
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE spelling correction; ChineseBert; self-distillation; multimodal
   information
AB Chinese spelling correction (CSC) models detect and correct a text typo based on the misspelled character and its context. Recently, Bert -based models have dominated the research of Chinese spelling correction . However, these methods only focus on the semantic information of the text during the pretraining stage, neglecting the learning of correcting spelling errors. Moreover, when multiple incorrect characters are in the text, the context introduces noisy information, making it difficult for the model to accurately detect the positions of the incorrect characters, leading to false corrections. To address these limitations, we apply the multimodal pretrained language model ChineseBert to the task of spelling correction. We propose a self-distillation learning-based pretraining strategy, where a confusion set is used to construct text containing erroneous characters, allowing the model to jointly learns how to understand language and correct spelling errors. Additionally, we introduce a single-channel masking mechanism to mitigate the noise caused by the incorrect characters. This mechanism masks the semantic encoding channel while preserving the phonetic and glyph encoding channels, reducing the noise introduced by incorrect characters during the prediction process. Finally, experiments are conducted on widely used benchmarks. Our model achieves superior performance against state -of -the -art methods by a remarkable gain.

AB Distance-aware quality adaptation is a potential approach to reduce the resource requirement for the transmission and rendering of textured 3D meshes. In this paper, we carry out a subjective experiment to investigate the effects of the distance from the camera on the perceptual quality of textured 3D meshes. Besides, we evaluate the effectiveness of eight image-based objective quality metrics in representing the user's perceptual quality. Our study found that the perceptual quality in terms of mean opinion score increases as the distance from the camera increases. In addition, it is shown that normalized mutual information (NMI), a full-reference objective quality metric, is highly correlated with subjective scores.

AB We explore the maximum total number of edge crossings and the maximum geometric thickness of the Euclidean minimum -weight (k , l)-tight graph on a planar point set P . In this paper, we show that (10 / 7 - & varepsilon;) | P | and (11 / 6 - & varepsilon; | P | are lower bounds for the maximum total number of edge crossings for any epsilon > 0 in cases (k , <euro>) = ( 2 , 3 ) and ( 2 , 2 ), respectively. We also show that the lower bound for the maximum geometric thickness is 3 for both cases. In the proofs, we apply the method of arranging isomorphic units regularly. While the method is developed for the proof in case (k , l) = ( 2 , 3 ), it also works for different l .

TI Content-Adaptive Optimization Framework for Universal Deep Image
   Compression
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE image compression; deep neural networks; universal compres- sion
AB While deep image compression performs better than traditional codecs like JPEG on natural images, it faces a challenge as a learningbased approach: compression performance drastically decreases for out -ofdomain images. To investigate this problem, we introduce a novel task that we call universal deep image compression, which involves compressing images in arbitrary domains, such as natural images, line drawings, and comics. Furthermore, we propose a content -adaptive optimization framework to tackle this task. This framework adapts a pre -trained compression model to each target image during testing for addressing the domain gap between pre -training and testing. For each input image, we insert adapters into the decoder of the model and optimize the latent representation extracted by the encoder and the adapter parameters in terms of rate -distortion, with the adapter parameters transmitted per image. To achieve the evaluation of the proposed universal deep compression, we constructed a benchmark dataset containing uncompressed images of four domains: natural images, line drawings, comics, and vector arts. We compare our proposed method with non -adaptive and existing adaptive compression methods, and the results show that our method outperforms them. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/kktsubota/universal-dic.

AB Infrared and visible image fusion can combine the thermal radiation information and the textures to provide a high-quality fused image. In this letter, we propose a hybrid variational fusion model to achieve this end. Specifically, an l0 term is adopted to preserve the highlighted targets with salient gradient variation in the infrared image, an l1 term is used to suppress the noise in the fused image and an l2 term is employed to keep the textures of the visible image. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed variational model and our results have more sharpen textures with less noise.

DE job scheduling; online learning; semi-matching; flow time
AB In this paper, we investigate an online job scheduling problem with n jobs and k servers, where the accessibilities between the jobs and the servers are given as a bipartite graph. The scheduler is tasked with minimizing the regret, defined as the difference between the total flowtime of the scheduler over T rounds and that of the best-fixed scheduling in hindsight. We propose an algorithm whose regret bounds are O(n(2) root T ln(nk) for general bipartite graphs, O((n(2)/k(1/2))root T ln(nk) for the complete bipartite graphs, and O(n(2)/k)root T ln(nk) for the disjoint star graphs, respectively. We also give a lower regret bound of Omega ((n(2)/k)root T) for the disjoint star graphs, implying that our regret bounds are almost optimal.

TI Solving Linear Regression with Insensitive Loss by Boosting
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE regression; bossting; insensitive loss
AB Following the formulation of Support Vector Regression (SVR), we consider a regression analogue of soft margin optimization over the feature space indexed by a hypothesis class H. More specifically, the problem is to find a linear model <bold>w</bold> is an element of R-H that minimizes the sum of rho-insensitive losses over all training data for as small rho as posssible, where the rho-insensitive loss for a single data (<bold>x</bold>(i), y(i)) is defined as max{|y(i) - Sigma(h) w(h)h(<bold>x</bold>(i))| - rho, 0}. Intuitively, the parameter rho and the rho-insensitive loss are defined analogously to the target margin and the hinge loss in soft margin optimization, respectively. The difference of our formulation from SVR is two-fold: (1) we consider L-1-norm regularization instead of L-2-norm regularization, and (2) the feature space is implicitly defined by a hypothesis class instead of a kernel. We propose a boosting-type algorithm for solving the problem with a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate under a natural assumption on the weak learnability.

AB Despite the increasing use of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in online discussion environments, few studies explore the application of AI as a facilitator in forming problem -solving debates and influencing opinions in cross -venue scenarios, particularly in diverse and war -ravaged countries. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI on enhancing participant engagement and collaborative problem -solving in online -mediated discussion environments, especially in diverse and heterogeneous discussion settings, such as the five cities in Afghanistan. We seek to assess the extent to which AI participation in online conversations succeeds by examining the depth of discussions and participants' contributions, comparing discussions facilitated by AI with those not facilitated by AI across different venues. The results are discussed with respect to forming and changing opinions with and without AI -mediated communication. The findings indicate that the number of opinions generated in AI -facilitated discussions significantly differs from discussions without AI support. Additionally, statistical analyses reveal quantitative disparities in online discourse sentiments when conversational AI is present compared to when it is absent. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of AI -mediated discussions and offer several practical and social implications, paving the way for future developments and improvements.

DE fault localization; TF-IDF; assisted programming
AB Providing students with useful feedback on faulty programs can effectively help students fix programs. Spectrum -Based Fault Location (SBFL), which is a widely studied and lightweight technique, can automatically generate a suspicious value of statement ranking to help users find potential faults in a program. However, the performance of SBFL on student programs is not satisfactory, to improve the accuracy of SBFL in student programs, we propose a novel Multi -Correct Programs based Fault Localization (MCPFL) approach. Specifically, We first collected the correct programs submitted by students on the OJ system according to the programming problem numbers and removed the highly similar correct programs based on code similarity, and then stored them together with the faulty program to be located to construct a set of programs. Afterward, we analyzed the suspiciousness of the term in the faulty program through the Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Finally, we designed a formula to calculate the weight of suspiciousness for program statements based on the number of input variables in the statement and weighted it to the spectrum -based fault localization formula. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCPFL, we conducted empirical studies on six student program datasets collected in our OJ system, and the results showed that MCPFL can effectively improve the traditional SBFL methods. In particular, on the EXAM metric, our approach improves by an average of 27.51% on the Dstar formula.

AB In Variant 4 of the one-way trading game [El-Yaniv, Fiat, Karp, and Turpin, 2001], a player has one dollar at the beginning and wants to convert it to yen only by one-way conversion. The exchange rate is guaranteed to fluctuate between m and M, and only the maximum fluctuation ratio co = M/m is informed to the player in advance. The performance of an algorithm for this game is measured by the competitive ratio. El-Yaniv et al. derived the best possible competitive ratio over all algorithms for this game. However, it seems that the behavior of the best possible algorithm itself has not been explicitly described. In this paper we reveal the behavior of the best possible algorithm by solving a linear optimization problem. The behavior turns out to be quite different from that of the best possible algorithm for Variant 2 in which the player knows m and M in advance.

TI Efficient Action Spotting Using Saliency Feature Weighting
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE action spotting; SoccerNet-v2; frame saliency
AB Action spotting is a key component in high-level video understanding. The large number of similar frames poses a challenge for recognizing actions in videos. In this paper we use frame saliency to represent the importance of frames for guiding the model to focus on keyframes. We propose the frame saliency weighting module to improve frame saliency and video representation at the same time. Our proposed model contains two encoders, for pre-action and post-action time windows, to encode video context. We validate our design choices and the generality of proposed method in extensive experiments. On the public SoccerNet-v2 dataset, the method achieves an average mAP of 57.3%, improving over the state of the art. Using embedding features obtained from multiple feature extractors, the average mAP further increases to 75%. We show that reducing the model size by over 90% does not significantly impact performance. Additionally, we use ablation studies to prove the effective of saliency weighting module. Further, we show that our frame saliency weighting strategy is applicable to existing methods on more general action datasets, such as SoccerNet-v1, ActivityNet v1.3, and UCF101.

AB This Letter focuses on deep learning -based monkeys' head swing counting problem. Nowadays, there are very few papers on monkey detection, and even fewer papers on monkeys' head swing counting. This research tries to fill in the gap and try to calculate the head swing frequency of monkeys through deep learning, where we further extend the traditional target detection algorithm. After analyzing object detection results, we localize the monkey's actions over a period. This Letter analyzes the task of counting monkeys' head swings, and proposes the standard that accurately describes a monkey's head swing. Under the guidance of this standard, the monkeys' head swing counting accuracy in 50 test videos reaches 94.23%.

AB In recent years, location -based technologies for ubiquitous environments have aimed to realize services tailored to each purpose based on information about an individual's current location. To establish such advanced location -based services, an estimation technology that accurately recognize and predict the movements of people and objects necessary. Although global positioning system (GPS) has already been as a standard for outdoor positioning technology and many services been realized, several techniques using conventional wireless sensors such as Wi-Fi, RFID, and Bluetooth have been considered for indoor positioning technology. However, conventional wireless indoor positioning is prone the effects of noise, and the large range of estimated indoor locations makes it difficult to identify human activities precisely. We propose a method mine user activity patterns from time -series data of user's locationss in indoor environment using ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors. An UWB sensor is useful for indoor positioning due to its high noise immunity and measurement accuracy, however, to our knowledge, estimation and prediction of human indoor activities using UWB sensors have not yet been addressed. The proposed method consists of three steps: 1) obtaining time -series of the user's location using a UWB sensor attached to the user, and estimating the areas where the user has stayed; 2) associating each of the user's stay with a nearby landmark of activity and assigning indoor activities; and 3) mining the user's activity patterns based on the user's indoor activities and their transitions. We conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed method by investigating the accuracy of estimating user's area of stay using a UWB sensor and observing the results of activity pattern mining applied to actual laboratory members over 30 -days. The sults showed that the proposed method is superior to a comparison method, Time -based clustering algorithm, in estimating the stay areas precisely, that it is possible to reveal the user's activity patterns appropriately in actual environment.

AB A 1 millisecond (1 -ms) vision system, which processes videos at 1000 frames per second (FPS) within 1 ms/frame delay, plays an increasingly important role in fields such as robotics and factory automation. Superpixel as one of the most extensively employed image oversegmentation methods is a crucial pre-processing step for reducing computations in various computer vision applications. Among the different superpixel methods, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) has gained widespread adoption due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and computational efficiency. However, the iterative assignment and update steps in SLIC make it challenging to achieve high processing speed. To address this limitation and develop a SLIC superpixel segmentation system with a 1 ms delay, this paper proposes grid sample based temporal iteration. By leveraging the high frame rate of the input video, the proposed method distributes the iterations into the temporal domain, ensuring that the system's delay keeps within one frame. Additionally, grid sample information is added as initialization information to the obtained superpixel centers for enhancing the stability of superpixels. Furthermore, a selective label propagation based pipeline architecture is proposed for parallel computation of all the possibilities of label propagation. This eliminates data dependency between adjacent pixels and enables a fully pipelined system. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed superpixel segmentation system achieves boundary recall and under -segmentation error comparable to the original SLIC algorithm. When considering label consistency, the proposed system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art superpixel segmentation methods. Moreover, in terms of hardware performance, the proposed system processes 1000 FPS images with 0.985 ms/frame delay.

TI An Intra- and Inter-Emotion Transformer-Based Fusion Model with
   Homogeneous and Diverse Constraints Using Multi-Emotional Audiovisual
   Features for Depression Detection

AB Depression is a prevalent mental disorder affecting a significant portion of the global population, leading to considerable disability and contributing to the overall burden of disease. Consequently, designing efficient and robust automated methods for depression detection has become imperative. Recently, deep learning methods, especially multimodal fusion methods, have been increasingly used in computer -aided depression detection. Importantly, individuals with depression and those without respond differently to various emotional stimuli, providing valuable information for detecting depression. Building on these observations, we propose an intraand inter -emotional stimulus transformer -based fusion model to effectively extract depression -related features. The intra-emotional stimulus fusion framework aims to prioritize different modalities, capitalizing on their diversity and complementarity for depression detection. The inter -emotional stimulus model maps each emotional stimulus onto both invariant and specific subspaces using individual invariant and specific encoders. The emotional stimulus -invariant subspace facilitates efficient information sharing and integration across different emotional stimulus categories, while the emotional stimulus specific subspace seeks to enhance diversity and capture the distinct characteristics of individual emotional stimulus categories. Our proposed intraand inter -emotional stimulus fusion model effectively integrates multimodal data under various emotional stimulus categories, providing a comprehensive representation that allows accurate task predictions in the context of depression detection. We evaluate the proposed model on the Chinese Soochow University students dataset, and the results outperform state-of-the-art models in terms of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and accuracy.

AB Negation scope resolution is the process of detecting the negated part of a sentence. Unlike the syntax-based approach employed in previous researches, state-of-the-art methods performed better without the explicit use of syntactic structure. This work revisits the syntax-based approach and re-evaluates the effectiveness of syntactic structure in negation scope resolution. We replace the parser utilized in the prior works with state-of-the-art parsers and modify the syntax-based heuristic rules. The experimental results demonstrate that the simple modifications enhance the performance of the prior syntax-based method to the same level as state-ofthe-art end-to-end neural-based methods.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB We introduce the Hexagonal Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN), a modified version of CNN that is robust against rotation. HCNN utilizes a hexagonal kernel and a multi -block structure that enjoys more degrees of rotation information sharing than standard convolution layers. Our structure is easy to use and does not affect the original tissue structure of the network. We achieve the complete rotational invariance on the recognition task of simple pattern images and demonstrate better performance on the recognition task of the rotated MNIST images, synthetic biomarker images and microscopic cell images than past methods, where the robustness to rotation matters.

TI Understanding Characteristics of Phishing Reports from Experts and

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

AB The increase in phishing attacks through email and short message service (SMS) has shown no signs of deceleration. The first thing we need to do to combat the ever-increasing number of phishing attacks is to collect and characterize more phishing cases that reach end users. Without understanding these characteristics, anti-phishing countermeasures cannot evolve. In this study, we propose an approach using Twitter as a new observation point to immediately collect and characterize phishing cases via e-mail and SMS that evade countermeasures and reach users. Specifically, we propose CrowdCanary, a system capable of structurally and accurately extracting phishing information (e.g., URLs and domains) from tweets about phishing by users who have actually discovered or encountered it. In our three months of live operation, CrowdCanary identified 35,432 phishing URLs out of 38,935 phishing reports. We confirmed that 31,960 (90.2%) of these phishing URLs were later detected by the anti-virus engine, demonstrating that CrowdCanary is superior to existing systems in both accuracy and volume of threat extraction. We also analyzed users who shared phishing threats by utilizing the extracted phishing URLs and categorized them into two distinct groups - namely, experts and non-experts. As a result, we found that CrowdCanary could collect information that is specifically included in non-expert reports, such as information shared only by the company brand name in the tweet, information about phishing attacks that we find only in the image of the tweet, and information about the landing page before the redirect. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of the collected information on phishing sites and discovered that certain biases exist in the domain names and hosting servers of phishing sites, revealing new characteristics useful for unknown phishing site detection.

AB Human action recognition (HAR) exhibits limited accuracy in video surveillance due to the 2D information captured with monocular cameras. To address the problem, a depth estimation-based human skeleton action recognition method (SARDE) is proposed in this study, with the aim of transforming 2D human action data into 3D format to dig hidden action clues in the 2D data. SARDE comprises two tasks, i.e., human skeleton action recognition and monocular depth estimation. The two tasks are integrated in a multi-task manner in end-to-end training to comprehensively utilize the correlation between action recognition and depth estimation by sharing parameters to learn the depth features effectively for human action recognition. In this study, graph-structured networks with inception blocks and skip connections are investigated for depth estimation. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in skeleton action recognition that the method reaches state-of-the-art on the datasets.

TI Sense-Aware Decoder for Character Based Japanese-Chinese NMT
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE NMT; sense-discriminated; Japanese-Chinese
AB Compared to subword based Neural Machine Translation (NMT), character based NMT eschews linguistic -motivated segmentation which performs directly on the raw character sequence, following a more absolute end -to -end manner. This property is more fascinating for machine translation (MT) between Japanese and Chinese, both of which use consecutive logographic characters without explicit word boundaries. However, there is still one disadvantage which should be addressed, that is, character is a less meaning -bearing unit than the subword, which requires the character models to be capable of sense discrimination. Specifically, there are two types of sense ambiguities existing in the source and target language, separately. With the former, it has been partially solved by the deep encoder and several existing works. But with the later, interestingly, the ambiguity in the target side is rarely discussed. To address this problem, we propose two simple yet effective methods, including a non -parametric pre -clustering for sense induction and a joint model to perform sense discrimination and NMT training simultaneously. Extensive experiments on Japanese -*Chinese MT show that our proposed methods consistently outperform the strong baselines, and verify the effectiveness of using sense -discriminated representation for character based NMT.

AB Software development companies must consider employees' job satisfaction and turnover intentions. To explain the related factors, this study focused on future perspective index (FPI). FPI was assumed to relate positively to satisfaction and negatively to turnover. In the analysis, we compared the FPI with existing factors that are considered to be related to job satisfaction. We discovered that the FPI was promising for enhancing explanatory power, particularly when analyzing satisfaction.

ID COMPUTATION
AB The purpose of Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is to automatically assess facial attractiveness based on human aesthetics. Most neural network -based prediction methods do not consider the ranking information in the task. For scoring tasks like facial beauty prediction, there is abundant ranking information both between images and within images. Reasonable utilization of these information during training can greatly improve the performance of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel end -to -end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on ranking information of images, incorporating a Rank Module and an Adaptive Weight Module. We also design pairwise ranking loss functions to fully leverage the ranking information of images. Considering training efficiency and model inference capability, we choose ResNet-50 as the backbone network. We conduct experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500 dataset and the results show that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, ablation experiments show that our approach greatly contributes to improving the model performance. Finally, the Rank Module with the corresponding ranking loss is plug -and -play and can be extended to any CNN model and any task with ranking information.

TI An Automated Multi-Phase Facilitation Agent Based on LLM

AB This paper presents the design and implementation of an automated multi -phase facilitation agent based on LLM to realize inclusive facilitation and efficient use of a large language model (LLM) to facilitate realistic discussions. Large-scale discussion support systems have been studied and implemented very widely since they enable a lot of people to discuss remotely and within 24 hours and 7 days. Furthermore, automated facilitation artificial intelligence (AI) agents have been realized since they can efficiently facilitate large-scale discussions. For example, D -Agree is a large-scale discussion support system where an automated facilitation AI agent facilitates discussion among people. Since the current automated facilitation agent was designed following the structure of the issue -based information system (IBIS) and the IBIS -based agent has been proven that it has superior performance. However, there are several problems that need to be addressed with the IBIS -based agent. In this paper, we focus on the following three problems: 1) The IBIS -based agent was designed to only promote other participants' posts by replying to existing posts accordingly, lacking the consideration of different behaviours taken by participants with diverse characteristics, leading to a result that sometimes the discussion is not sufficient. 2) The facilitation messages generated by the IBIS -based agent were not natural enough, leading to consequences that the participants were not sufficiently promoted and the participants did not follow the flow to discuss a topic. 3) Since the IBIS -based agent is not combined with LLM, designing the control of LLM is necessary. Thus, to solve the problems mentioned above, the design of a phase -based facilitation framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we propose two significant designs: One is the design for a multi -phase facilitation agent created based on the framework to address problem 1); The other one is the design for the combination with LLM to address problem 2) and 3). Particularly, the language model called "GPT-3.5" is used for the combination by using corresponding APIs from OPENAI. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improvement of our facilitation agent framework by presenting the evaluations and a case study. Besides, we present the difference between our framework and LangChain which has generic features to utilize LLMs.

AB Air Traffic Control (ATC) communication suffers from issues such as high electromagnetic interference, fast speech rate, and low intelligibility, which pose challenges for downstream tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This article aims to research how to enhance the audio quality and intelligibility of civil aviation speech through speech enhancement methods, thereby improving the accuracy of speech recognition and providing support for the digitalization of civil aviation. We propose a speech enhancement model called DIUnet_V (DenseNet & Inception & UNet & Volume) that combines both time -frequency and time -domain methods to effectively handle the specific characteristics of civil aviation speech, such as predominant electromagnetic interference and fast speech rate. For model evaluation, we assess the denoising and enhancement effects using three metrics: Signal -to -Noise Ratio (SNR), Mean Opinion Score (MOS), and speech recognition error rate. On a simulated ATC training recording dataset, DIUnet_Volume10 achieved an SNR value of 7.3861, showing a 4.5663 improvement compared to the original U -net model. To address the challenge of the absence of clean speech in the ATC working environment, which makes it difficult to accurately calculate SNR, we propose evaluating the denoising effects indirectly based on the recognition performance of an ATC speech recognition system. On a real ATC speech dataset, the average word error rate decreased by 1.79% absolute and the average sentence error rate decreased by 3% absolute for DIUnet_V processed speech compared to the unprocessed speech in the built speech recognition system.

AB This study discusses the feasibility to estimate the concentration level of Japanese document workers using computer. Based on the previous findings that dual -task scenarios increase reaction time, we hypothesized that the Kana-Kanji conversion confirmation time (KKCCT) would increase due to the decrease in cognitive resources allocated to the document task, i.e. the level of concentration on the task at hand. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a set of experiments in which sixteen participants copied Kana text by typing and concurrently converted it into Kanji under three conditions: Normal, Dual -task, and Mental -fatigue. The results suggested the feasibility that KKCCT increased when participants were less concentrated on the task due to subtask or mental fatigue. These findings imply the potential utility of using confirmation time as a measure of concentration level in document workers.

AB Acoustic scene classification (ASC) is a fundamental domain within the realm of artificial intelligence classification tasks. ASCbased tasks commonly employ models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that utilize log-Mel spectrograms as input for gathering acoustic features. In this paper, we designed a CNN-based multi-scale pooling (MSP) strategy for ASC. The log-Mel spectrograms are utilized as the input to CNN, which is partitioned into four frequency axis segments. Furthermore, we devised four CNN channels to acquire inputs from distinct frequency ranges. The high-level features extracted from outputs in various frequency bands are integrated through frequency pyramid average pooling layers at multiple levels. Subsequently, a softmax classifier is employed to classify different scenes. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of our designed model leads to a significant enhancement in the model's performance, as evidenced by the testing of two acoustic datasets.

AB Song-level feature summarization is fundamental for the browsing, retrieval, and indexing of digital music archives. This study proposes a deep neural network model, CQTXNet, for extracting song-level feature summary for cover song identification. CQTXNet incorporates depth-wise separable convolution, residual network connections, and attention models to extend previous approaches. An experimental evaluation of the proposed CQTXNet was performed on two publicly available cover song datasets by varying the number of network layers and the type of attention modules.

ID SOUNDS
AB Owing to the several cases wherein abnormal sounds, called adventitious sounds, are included in the lung sounds of a patient suffering from pulmonary disease, the objective of this study was to automatically detect abnormal sounds from auscultatory sounds. To this end, we expressed the acoustic features of the normal lung sounds of healthy people and abnormal lung sounds of patients using Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-hidden Markov models (HMMs), and distinguished between normal and abnormal lung sounds. In our previous study, we constructed left -to -right GMM-HMMs with a limited number of states. Because we expressed abnormal sounds that occur intermittently and repeatedly using limited states, the GMM-HMMs could not express the acoustic features of abnormal sounds. Furthermore, because the analysis frame length and intervals were long, the GMM-HMMs could not express the acoustic features of short time segments, such as heart sounds. Therefore, the classification rate of normal and abnormal respiration was low (86.60%). In this study, we propose the construction of ergodic GMM-HMMs with a repetitive structure for intermittent sounds. Furthermore, we considered a suitable frame length and frame interval to analyze acoustic features. Using the ergodic GMM-HMM, which can express the acoustic features of abnormal sounds and heart sounds that occur repeatedly in detail, the classification rate increased (89.34%). The results obtained in this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB A major approach to enhancing software quality is reviewing the source code to identify defects. To aid in identifying flaws, an approach in which a machine learning model predicts residual defects after implementing a code review is adopted. After the model has predicted the existence of residual defects, a second -round review is performed to identify such residual flaws. To enhance the prediction accuracy of the model, information known to developers but not recorded as data is utilized. Confidence in the review is evaluated by reviewers using a 10 -point scale. The assessment result is used as an independent variable of the prediction model of residual defects. Experimental results indicate that confidence improves the prediction accuracy.

AB Most existing multi-view subspace clustering approaches only capture the inter-view similarities between different views and ignore the optimal local geometric structure of the original data. To this end, in this letter, we put forward a novel method named shared latent embedding learning for multi-view subspace clustering (SLE-MSC), which can efficiently capture a better latent space. To be specific, we introduce a pseudo-label constraint to capture the intra-view similarities within each view. Meanwhile, we utilize a novel optimal graph Laplacian to learn the consistent latent representation, in which the common manifold is considered as the optimal manifold to obtain a more reasonable local geometric structure. Comprehensive experimental results indicate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Improved Head and Data Augmentation to Reduce Artifacts at Grid
   Boundaries in Object Detection
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE object detection; deep neural networks; shift; data augmentation
AB We investigated the influence of horizontal shifts of the input images for one stage object detection method. We found that the object detector class scores drop when the target object center is at the grid boundary. Many approaches have focused on reducing the aliasing effect of down-sampling to achieve shift-invariance. However, down-sampling does not completely solve this problem at the grid boundary; it is necessary to suppress the dispersion of features in pixels close to the grid boundary into adjacent grid cells. Therefore, this paper proposes two approaches focused on the grid boundary to improve this weak point of current object detection methods. One is the Sub-Grid Feature Extraction Module, in which the sub-grid features are added to the input of the classification head. The other is Grid-Aware Data Augmentation, where augmented data are generated by the grid-level shifts and are used in training. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated using the COCO validation set after applying the proposed method to the FCOS architecture.

AB Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which finds extensive applications in various domains, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. Syntactic information can be effectively utilized to improve the performance of neural network models in understanding the semantics of text. The Chinese text exhibits a high degree of syntactic complexity, with individual words often possessing multiple parts of speech. In this paper, we propose BRsyn-caps, a capsule network -based Chinese text classification model that leverages both Bert and dependency syntax. Our proposed approach integrates semantic information through Bert pre -training model for obtaining word representations, extracts contextual information through Long Short-term memory neural network (LSTM), encodes syntactic dependency trees through graph attention neural network, and utilizes capsule network to effectively integrate features for text classification. Additionally, we propose a character -level syntactic dependency tree adjacency matrix construction algorithm, which can introduce syntactic information into character -level representation. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that BRsyn-caps can effectively integrate semantic, sequential, and syntactic information in text, proving the effectiveness of our proposed method for Chinese text classification.

AB Deep learning techniques are used to transform the style of images and produce diverse images. In the text style transformation field, many previous studies attempted to generate stylized text using deep learning networks. However, to achieve multiple style transformations for text images, the methods proposed in previous studies require learning multiple networks or cannot be guided by style images. Thus, in this study we focused on multistyle transformation of text images using style images to guide the generation of results. We propose a multiple -style transformation network for text style transfer, which we refer to as the Multi -Style Shape Matching GAN (Multi -Style SMGAN). The proposed method generates multiple styles of text images using a single model by training the model only once, and allows users to control the text style according to style images. The proposed method implements conditions to the network such that all styles can be distinguished effectively in the network, and the generation of each styled text can be controlled according to these conditions. The proposed network is optimized such that the conditional information can be transmitted effectively throughout the network. The proposed method was evaluated experimentally on a large number of text images, and the results show that the trained model can generate multiple -style text in realtime according to the style image. In addition, the results of a user survey study indicate that the proposed method produces higher quality results compared to existing methods.

AB With the popularization of software defined networks, switch migration as an important network management strategy has attracted increasing attention. Most existing switch migration strategies only consider local conditions and simple load thresholds, without fully considering the overall optimization and dynamics of the network. Therefore, this article proposes a switch migration algorithm based on global optimization. This algorithm adds a load prediction module to the migration model, determines the migration controller, and uses an improved whale optimization algorithm to determine the target controller and its surrounding controller set. Based on the load status of the controller and the traffic priority of the switch to be migrated, the optimal migration switch set is determined. The experimental results show that compared to existing schemes, the algorithm proposed in this paper improves the average flow processing efficiency by 15% to 40%, reduces switch migration times, and enhances the security of the controller.

AB Fish skin color detection plays a critical role in aquaculture. However, challenges arise from image color cast and the limited dataset, impacting the accuracy of the skin color detection process. To address these issues, we proposed a novel fish skin color detection method, termed VH-YOLOv5s. Specifically, we constructed a dataset for fish skin color detection to tackle the limitation posed by the scarcity of available datasets. Additionally, we proposed a Variance Gray World Algorithm (VGWA) to correct the image color cast. Moreover, the designed Hybrid Spatial Pyramid Pooling (HSPP) module effectively performs multi -scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the feature representation capability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that VH-YOLOv5s achieves excellent detection results on the Plectropomus leopardus skin color dataset, with a precision of 91.7%, recall of 90.1%, mAP@0.5 of 95.2%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 57.5%. When compared to other models such as Centernet, AutoAssign, and YOLOX-s, VH-YOLOv5s exhibits superior detection performance, surpassing them by 2.5%, 1.8%, and 1.7%, respectively. Furthermore, our model can be deployed directly on mobile phones, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

ID PERSON REIDENTIFICATION
AB Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) aims to recognize a series of a person's semantic attributes, e.g., age, gender, which plays an important role in video surveillance. This paper proposes a multi-cor relation graph convolutional network named MCGCN for PAR, which includes a semantic graph, visual graph, and synthesis graph. We construct a semantic graph by using attribute features with semantic constraints. A graph convolution is employed, based on prior knowledge of the dataset, to learn the semantic correlation. 2D features are projected onto visual graph nodes and each node corresponds to the feature region of each attribute group. Graph convolution is then utilized to learn regional correlation. The visual graph nodes are connected to the semantic graph nodes to form a synthesis graph. In the synthesis graph, regional and semantic correlation are embedded into each other through inter-graph edges, to guide each other's learning and to update the visual and semantic graph, thereby constructing semantic and regional correlation. On this basis, we use a better loss weighting strategy, the suit_polyloss, to address the imbalance of pedestrian attribute datasets. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior recognition performance compared to existing technologies, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB Representation learning is a crucial and complex task for multivariate time series data analysis, with a wide range of applications including trend analysis, time series data search, and forecasting. In practice, unsupervised learning is strongly preferred owing to sparse labeling. However, most existing studies focus on the representation of individual subseries without considering relationships between different subseries. In certain scenarios, this may lead to downstream task failures. Here, an unsupervised representation learning model is proposed for multivariate time series that considers the semantic relationship among subseries of time series. Specifically, the covariance calculated by the Gaussian process (GP) is introduced to the self -attention mechanism, capturing relationship features of the subseries. Additionally, a novel unsupervised method is designed to learn the representation of multivariate time series. To address the challenges of variable lengths of input subseries, a temporal pyramid pooling (TPP) method is applied to construct input vectors with equal length. The experimental results show that our model has substantial advantages compared with other representation learning models. We conducted experiments on the proposed algorithm and baseline algorithms in two downstream tasks: classification and retrieval. In classification task, the proposed model demonstrated the best performance on seven of ten datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 76%. In retrieval task, the proposed algorithm achieved the best performance under different datasets and hidden sizes. The result of ablation study also demonstrates significance of semantic relationship in multivariate time series representation learning.

AB The goal of Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is to simulate human analysis of the surrounding environment and make accurate decisions promptly. Extracting useful information from audio signals in real-world scenarios is challenging and can lead to suboptimal performance in acoustic scene classification, especially in environments with relatively homogeneous backgrounds. To address this problem, we model the sobering-up process of "drunkards" in real-life and the guiding behavior of normal people, and construct a high-precision lightweight model implementation methodology called the "drunkard methodology". The core idea includes three parts: (1) designing a special feature transformation module based on the different mechanisms of information perception between drunkards and ordinary people, to simulate the process of gradually sobering up and the changes in feature perception ability; (2) studying a lightweight "drunken" model that matches the normal model's perception processing process. The model uses a multi-scale class residual block structure and can obtain finer feature representations by fusing information extracted at different scales; (3) introducing a guiding and fusion module of the conventional model to the "drunken" model to speed up the sobering up process and achieve iterative optimization and accuracy improvement. Evaluation results on the official dataset of DCASE2022 Task1 demonstrate that our baseline system achieves 40.4% accuracy and 2.284 loss under the condition of 442.67K parameters and 19.40M MAC (multiply-accumulate operations). After adopting the "drunkard" mechanism, the accuracy is improved to 45.2%, and the loss is reduced by 0.634 under the condition of 551.89K parameters and 23.6M MAC.

AB A practical issue of edge AI systems is that data distributions of trained dataset and deployed environment may differ due to noise and environmental changes over time. Such a phenomenon is known as a concept drift, and this gap degrades the performance of edge AI systems and may introduce system failures. To address this gap, retraining of neural network models triggered by concept drift detection is a practical approach. However, since available compute resources are strictly limited in edge devices, in this paper we propose a fully sequential concept drift detection method in cooperation with an on -device sequential learning technique of neural networks. In this case, both the neural network retraining and the proposed concept drift detection are done only by sequential computation to reduce computation cost and memory utilization. We use three datasets for experiments and compare the proposed approach with existing batchbased detection methods. It is also compared with a DNN-based approach without concept drift detection. The evaluation results of the proposed approach show that the proposed method is capable of detecting each of four concept drift types. The results also show that, while the accuracy is decreased by up to 0.9% compared to the existing batch -based detection methods, it decreases the memory size by 88.9%-96.4% and the execution time by 45.0%-87.6%. As a result, the combination of the neural network retraining and the proposed concept drift detection method is demonstrated on Raspberry Pi Pico that has 264 kB memory.

AB Both group process studies and collective intelligence studies are concerned with "which of the crowds and the best members perform better." This can be seen as a matter of democracy versus dictatorship. Having evidence of the growth potential of crowds and experts can be useful in making correct predictions and can benefit humanity. In the collective intelligence experimental paradigm, experts' or best members ability is compared with the accuracy of the crowd average. In this research (n = 620), using repeated trials of simple tasks, we compare the correct answer of a class average (index of collective intelligence) and the best member (the one whose answer was closest to the correct answer). The results indicated that, for the cognition task, collective intelligence improved to the level of the best member through repeated trials without feedback; however, it depended on the ability of the best members for the prediction task. The present study suggested that best members' superiority over crowds for the prediction task on the premise of being free from social influence. However, machine learning results suggests that the best members among us cannot be easily found beforehand because they appear through repeated trials.

AB In Natural Language Understanding, intent detection and slot filling have been widely used to understand user queries. However, current methods tend to rely on single words and sentences to understand complex semantic concepts, and can only consider local information within the sentence. Therefore, they usually cannot capture long-distance dependencies well and are prone to problems where complex intentions in sentences are difficult to recognize. In order to solve the problem of longdistance dependency of the model, this paper uses ConceptNet as an external knowledge source and introduces its extensive semantic information into the multi -intent detection and slot filling model. Specifically, for a certain sentence, based on confidence scores and semantic relationships, the most relevant conceptual knowledge is selected to equip the sentence, and a concept context map with rich information is constructed. Then, the multi -head graph attention mechanism is used to strengthen context correlation and improve the semantic understanding ability of the model. The experimental results indicate that the model has significantly improved performance compared to other models on the MixATIS and MixSNIPS multi -intent datasets.

TI A Novel Anomaly Detection Framework Based on Model Serialization

DT Article
DE anomaly detection; multivariate time-series data
AB Recently, multivariate time-series data has been generated in various environments, such as sensor networks and IoT, making anomaly detection in time-series data an essential research topic. Unsupervised learning anomaly detectors identify anomalies by training a model on normal data and producing high residuals for abnormal observations. However, a fundamental issue arises as anomalies do not consistently result in high residuals, necessitating a focus on the time-series patterns of residuals rather than individual residual sizes. In this paper, we present a novel framework comprising two serialized anomaly detectors: the first model calculates residuals as usual, while the second one evaluates the time-series pattern of the computed residuals to determine whether they are normal or abnormal. Experiments conducted on real-world time-series data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB A user wearing a Head -Mounted Display (HMD) is likely to feel isolated when sharing virtual reality (VR) experiences with NonHMD users in the same physical space due to not being able to see the real space outside the virtual world. This research proposes a method for an HMD user to recognize the Non-HMD users' gaze and attention via a projector attached to the HMD. In the proposed approach, the projected HMD user's view is filtered darker than default, and when Non-HMD users point controllers towards the projected view, the filter is removed from a circular area for both HMD and Non-HMD users indicating which region the Non-HMD users are viewing. We conducted two user studies showing that the Non-HMD users' gaze can be recognized with the proposed method, and investigated the preferred range for the alpha value and the size of the area for removing the filter for the HMD user.

TI Hierarchical Latent Alignment for Non-Autoregressive Generation under
   High Compression Ratio
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE abstractive summarization; non-autoregressive generation; latent
   alignment; connectionist temporal classification
AB Non-autoregressive generation has attracted more and more attention due to its fast decoding speed. Latent alignment objectives, such as CTC, are designed to capture the monotonic alignments between the predicted and output tokens, which have been used for machine translation and sentence summarization. However, our preliminary experiments revealed that CTC performs poorly on document abstractive summarization, where a high compression ratio between the input and output is involved. To address this issue, we conduct a theoretical analysis and propose Hierarchical Latent Alignment (HLA). The basic idea is a two-step alignment process: we first align the sentences in the input and output, and subsequently derive token -level alignment using CTC based on aligned sentences. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on two widely used datasets XSUM and CNNDM. The results indicate that our proposed method exhibits remarkable scalability even when dealing with high compression ratios.

AB Memory-based Programmable Logic Device (MPLD) is a new type of reconfigurable device constructed using a general SRAM array in a unique interconnect configuration. This research aims to propose approaches to guarantee the long-term reliability of MPLDs, including a test method to identify interconnect defects in the SRAM array during the production phase and a delay monitoring technique to detect aging caused failures. The proposed test method configures pre-generated test configuration data into SRAMs to create fault propagation paths, applies an external walking-zero/one vector to excite faults, and identifies faults at the external output ports. The proposed delay monitoring method configures a novel ring oscillator logic design into MPLD to measure delay variations when the device is in practical use. The logic simulation results with fault injection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TI Federated Learning of Neural ODE Models with Different Iteration Counts
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE federated learning; neural networks; neural ODE
AB Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach in which clients train models locally with their own data and upload them to a server so that their trained results are shared between them without uploading raw data to the server. There are some challenges in federated learning, such as communication size reduction and client heterogeneity. The former can mitigate the communication overheads, and the latter can allow the clients to choose proper models depending on their available compute resources. To address these challenges, in this paper, we utilize Neural ODE based models for federated learning. The proposed flexible federated learning approach can reduce the communication size while aggregating models with different iteration counts or depths. Our contribution is that we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed federated learning can aggregate models with different iteration counts or depths. It is compared with a different federated learning approach in terms of the accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our approach can reduce communication size by up to 89.4% compared with a baseline ResNet model using CIFAR-10 dataset.

In the practice of fault localization, a typical process usually includes three steps: execution of input domain test cases, construction of model domain test vectors and suspiciousness evaluation. The effectiveness of model domain test vectors is significant for locating the faulty code. However, test vectors with failing labels usually account for a small portion, which inevitably degrades the effectiveness of fault localization. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method PVaug by using fault propagation context and variational autoencoder (VAE). Our empirical results on 14 programs illustrate that PVaug has promoted the effectiveness of fault localization.

DE functionally-equivalent methods; source code analysis; dataset; code

AB Modern high-level programming languages have a wide variety of grammar and can implement the required functionality in different ways. The authors believe that a large amount of code that implements the same functionality in different ways exists even in open source software where the source code is publicly available, and that by collecting such code, a useful data set can be constructed for various studies in software engineering. In this study, we construct a dataset of pairs of Java methods that have the same functionality but different structures from approximately 314 million lines of source code. To construct this dataset, the authors used an automated test generation technique, EvoSuite . Test cases generated by automated test generation techniques have the property that the test cases always succeed. In constructing the dataset, using this property, test cases generated from two methods were executed against each other to automatically determine whether the behavior of the two methods is the same to some extent. Pairs of methods for which all test cases succeeded in cross -running test cases are manually investigated to be functionally equivalent. This paper also reports the results of an accuracy evaluation of code clone detection tools using the constructed dataset. The purpose of this evaluation is assessing how accurately code clone detection tools could find the functionally equivalent methods, not assessing the accuracy of detecting ordinary clones. The constructed dataset is available at github (https://github.com/YoshikiHigo/FEMPDataset).

AB E -learning, which can be used anywhere and at any time, is very convenient and has been introduced to improve learning efficiency. However, securing a completion rate has been a major challenge. Recently, the learning forms of e -learning require learners to be introspective, deliberate, and logical and have proven to be incompatible with many learners with low completion rates. Thus, we developed an e -learning system that incorporates a fill -in -the -blank question -type concept map to deepen learners' understanding of learning contents while watching learning videos. The developed system promotes active learning reflectively and logically by allowing learners to answer blank question labels on concept maps from video content and labels associated with the blank question labels. We confirmed in the laboratory experiment by comparing with a conventional video -based learning system that the developed system encouraged a learner to do more system operations for rechecking the learning content and to better understand the learning contents while watching the learning video. As the next step, a field experiment is needed to investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of the developed system in actual environments in order to boost the practicality of the developed system. In this study, we introduced the developed system into the two class of the uviversity course and investigated the level of understanding to the learning contents, the system operations, and the usefulness of the developed system by comparing with those in the laboratory experiment. The results showed that the developed system provided to support the understanding to learning content and the usefulness of each function in the field experiment, as in the laboratory experiment. On the other hand, the students in the field experiment gave lower usefulness of the developed system than those in the lab experiment, suggesting that the students who attempted to thoroughly understand the learning contents in the field experiment were fewer than those in the lab experiment from their system operations during the learning.

AB In this study, a Coanda-drone with length, width, and height of 121.6, 121.6, and 191[mm] was designed, and its total mass was 1166.7[g]. Using four propulsion devices, it could produce a maximum of 5428[g] thrust. Its structure is very different from conventional drones because in this study it combines the design of the jet engine of a jet fixed -wing drone with the fuselage structure layout of a rotary -wing drone. The advantage of jet drone's high propulsion is kept so that it can output greater thrust under the same variation of PWM waveform output. In this study, the propulsion device performs high-speed jetting, and the airflow around the propulsion device will also be jetted downward along the direction of the airflow.

TI A Combined Alignment Model for Code Search

AB Code search is a task to retrieve the most relevant code given a natural language query. Several recent studies proposed deep learning based methods use multi -encoder model to parse code into multi -field to represent code. These methods enhance the performance of the model by distinguish between similar codes and utilizing a relation matrix to bridge the code and query. However, these models require more computational resources and parameters than single -encoder models. Furthermore, utilizing the relation matrix that solely relies on max -pooling disregards the delivery of word alignment information. To alleviate these problems, we propose a combined alignment model for code search. We concatenate the multi -code fields into one sequence to represent code and use one encoding model to encode code features. Moreover, we transform the relation matrix using trainable vectors to avoid information losses. Then, we combine intramodal and cross -modal attention to assign the salient words while matching the corresponding code and query. Finally, we apply the attention weight to code/query embedding and compute the cosine similarity. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compare our model with six previous models on two popular datasets. The results show that our model achieves 0.614 and 0.687 Top@1 performance, outperforming the best comparison models by 12.2% and 9.3%, respectively.

DE facial beauty prediction; dynamic convolution; kernel attention
AB Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a significant pattern recognition task that aims to achieve consistent facial attractiveness assessment with human perception. Currently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the mainstream method for FBP. The training objective of most conventional CNNs is usually to learn static convolution kernels, which, however, makes the network quite difficult to capture global attentive information, and thus usually ignores the key facial regions, e.g., eyes, and nose. To tackle this problem, we devise a new convolution manner, Dynamic Attentive Convolution (DyAttenConv), which integrates the dynamic and attention mechanism into convolution in kernel -level, with the aim of enforcing the convolution kernels adapted to each face dynamically. DyAttenConv is a plug -and -play module that can be flexibly combined with existing CNN architectures, making the acquisition of the beauty -related features more globally and attentively. Extensive ablation studies show that our method is superior to other fusion and attention mechanisms, and the comparison with other state -of -the -arts also demonstrates the effectiveness of DyAttenConv on facial beauty prediction task.

AB Record/replay is one essential tool in clouds to provide many capabilities such as fault tolerance, software debugging, and security analysis by recording the execution into a log and replaying it deterministically later on. However, in virtualized environments, the log file increases heavily due to saving a considerable amount of I/O data, finally introducing significant storage costs. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes RR-Row, a redirecton-write based virtual machine disk for record/replay scenarios. RR-Row appends the written data into new blocks rather than overwrites the original blocks during normal execution so that all written data are reserved in the disk. In this way, the record system only saves the block id instead of the full content, and the replay system can directly fetch the data from the disk rather than the log, thereby reducing the log size a lot. In addition, we propose several optimizations for improving I/O performance so that it is also suitable for normal execution. We implement RR-Row for QEMU and conduct a set of experiments. The results show that RR-Row reduces the log size by 68% compared to the currently used Raw/QCow2 disk without compromising I/O performance. and events vide deterministic

ID ALGORITHM
AB The increasing demand for high-performance computing in recent years has led to active research on massively parallel systems. The interconnection network in a massively parallel system interconnects hundreds of thousands of processing elements so that they can process large tasks while communicating among others. By regarding the processing elements as nodes and the links between processing elements as edges, respectively, we can discuss various problems of interconnection networks in the framework of the graph theory. Many topologies have been proposed for interconnection networks of massively parallel systems. The hypercube is a very popular topology and it has many variants. The cross-cube is such a topology, which can be obtained by adding one extra edge to each node of the hypercube. The cross-cube reduces the diameter of the hypercube, and allows cycles of odd lengths. Therefore, we focus on the cross-cube and propose an algorithm that constructs disjoint paths from a node to a set of nodes. We give a proof of correctness of the algorithm. Also, we show that the time complexity and the maximum path length of the algorithm are O(n(3) log n) and 2n - 3, respectively. Moreover, we estimate that the average execution time of the algorithm is O(n(2)) based on a computer experiment.

TI Speech Rhythm-Based Speaker Embeddings Extraction from Phonemes and
   Phoneme Duration for Multi-Speaker Speech Synthesis
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE speaker embedding; phoneme duration; speech synthesis; speech rhythm
AB This paper proposes a speech rhythm-based method for speaker embeddings to model phoneme duration using a few utterances by the target speaker. Speech rhythm is one of the essential factors among speaker characteristics, along with acoustic features such as F0, for re-producing individual utterances in speech synthesis. A novel feature of the proposed method is the rhythm-based embeddings extracted from phonemes and their durations, which are known to be related to speaking rhythm. They are extracted with a speaker identification model similar to the conventional spectral feature-based one. We conducted three experiments, speaker em-beddings generation, speech synthesis with generated embeddings, and em-bedding space analysis, to evaluate the performance. The proposed method demonstrated a moderate speaker identification performance (15.2% EER), even with only phonemes and their duration information. The objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method can synthesize speech with speech rhythm closer to the target speaker than the conventional method. We also visualized the embeddings to evaluate the relationship between the distance of the embeddings and the perceptual similarity. The visualization of the embedding space and the relation anal-ysis between the closeness indicated that the distribution of embeddings reflects the subjective and objective similarity.

TI Unbiased Pseudo-Labeling for Learning with Noisy Labels
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE key deep learning; learning with noisy labels; semi-supervised learning;
   causal inference
AB Noisy labels in training data can significantly harm the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent research on learning with noisy labels uses a property of DNNs called the memorization effect to divide the training data into a set of data with reliable labels and a set of data with unreliable labels. Methods introducing semi-supervised learning strategies discard the unreliable labels and assign pseudo-labels generated from the confident predictions of the model. So far, this semi-supervised strategy has yielded the best results in this field. However, we observe that even when models are trained on balanced data, the distribution of the pseudo-labels can still exhibit an imbalance that is driven by data similarity. Additionally, a data bias is seen that originates from the division of the training data using the semi-supervised method. If we address both types of bias that arise from pseudo-labels, we can avoid the decrease in generalization performance caused by biased noisy pseudo-labels. We propose a learning method with noisy labels that introduces unbiased pseudo-labeling based on causal inference. The proposed method achieves significant accuracy gains in experiments at high noise rates on the standard benchmarks CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

AB In the research of machine reading comprehension of Japanese how-to tip QA tasks, conventional extractive machine reading comprehension methods have difficulty in dealing with cases in which the answer string spans multiple locations in the context. The method of finetuning of the BERT model for machine reading comprehension tasks is not suitable for such cases. In this paper, we trained a generative machine reading comprehension model of Japanese how-to tip by constructing a generative dataset based on the website "wikihow" as a source of information. We then proposed two methods for multi-task learning to fine-tune the generative model. The first method is the multi-task learning with a generative and extractive hybrid training dataset, where both generative and extractive datasets are simultaneously trained on a single model. The second method is the multi-task learning with the inter-sentence semantic similarity and answer generation, where, drawing upon the answer generation task, the model additionally learns the distance between the sentences of the question/context and the answer in the training examples. The evaluation results showed that both of the multi-task learning methods significantly outperformed the single-task learning method in generative question-and-answer examples. Between the two methods for multi-task learning, that with the intersentence semantic similarity and answer generation performed the best in terms of the manual evaluation result. The data and the code are available at https://github.com/EternalEdenn/multitask_ext-gen_sts-gen.

   projection photometric compensation
AB In this paper, we present a novel photometric compensation network named CASEformer, which is built upon the Swin module. For the first time, we combine coordinate attention and channel attention mechanisms to extract rich features from input images. Employing a multi-level encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, we establish multiscale interactions between projection surfaces and projection images, achieving precise inference and compensation. Furthermore, through an attention fusion module, which simultaneously leverages both coordinate and channel information, we enhance the global context of feature maps while preserving enhanced texture coordinate details. The experimental results demonstrate the superior compensation effectiveness of our approach compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose a method for multi-surface projection compensation, further enriching our contributions.

AB Text-based communication, such as text chat, is commonly employed in various contexts, both professional and personal. However, it lacks the rich emotional cues present in verbal and visual forms of communication, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, making it more challenging to convey emotions and increasing the likelihood of misunderstandings. In this study, we focused on typefaces as emotional cues employed in text-based communication and investigated the influence of font design on impression formation and decision-making through two experiments. The results of the experiments revealed the relationship between Japanese typeface design and impression formation, and indicated that advice presented in a font evoking an impression of high confidence was more likely to be accepted than advice presented in a font evoking an impression of low confidence.

TI Non-Cooperative Rational Synthesis Problem on Stochastic Games for
   Positional Strategies*
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Nash equilibrium; non-cooperative rational synthesis; co-regular
   objective
AB Synthesis problems on multiplayer non -zero -sum games (MG) with multiple environment players that behave rationally are the problems to find a good strategy of the system and have been extensively studied. This paper concerns the synthesis problems on stochastic MG (SMG), where a special controller other than players, called nature, which chooses a move in its turn randomly, may exist. Two types of synthesis problems on SMG exist: cooperative rational synthesis problem (CRSP) and non -cooperative rational synthesis problem (NCRSP). The rationality of environment players is modeled by Nash equilibria, and CRSP is the problem to decide whether there exists a Nash equilibrium that gives the system a payoff not less than a given threshold. Ummels et al. studied the complexity of CRSP for various classes of objectives and strategies of players. CRSP fits the situation where the system can make a suggestion of a strategy profile (a tuple of strategies of all players) to the environment players. However, in real applications, the system may rarely have an opportunity to make suggestions to the environment, and thus CRSP is optimistic. NCRSP is the problem to decide whether there exists a strategy cr0 of the system satisfying that for every strategy profile of the environment players that forms a 0 -fixed Nash equilibrium (a Nash equilibrium where the system's strategy is fixed to cr0), the system obtains a payoff not less than a given threshold. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of NCRSP for positional (i.e. pure memoryless) strategies. We consider co -regular objectives as the model of players' objectives, and show the complexity results of the problem for several subclasses of co -regular objectives. In particular, the problem for terminal reachability (TR) objectives is shown to be -complete.

TI rOOM: A Rust-Based Linux Out of Memory Kernel Component
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

AB The Linux kernel has been applied in various securitysensitive fields, so ensuring its security is crucial. Vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are usually caused by undefined behaviors of the C programming language, the most threatening of which are memory safety vulnerabilities. Both the software-based and hardware approaches to memory safety have disadvantages of poor performance, false positives, and poor compatibility. This paper explores the feasibility of using the safe programming language Rust to reconstruct a Linux kernel component and open-source the component's code. We leverage the Rust FFI mechanism to design a safe foreign interface layer to enable the reconstructed component to invoke other Linux functionalities, and then use Rust to reconstruct the component, during which we leverage Rust's type-safety and ownership mechanisms to improve its security, and finally export the C interface of the component to enable the invocation by the Linux kernel. The performance and memory overhead of the reconstructed component, referred to as "rOOM", were evaluated, revealing a performance overhead of 8.9% in kernel mode, 5% in user mode, 3% in real time, and a memory overhead of 0.06%. These results suggest that it is possible to develop key components of the Linux kernel using Rust in terms of functionality, performance, and memory overhead.

AB This paper proposes graph linear notations and an extension of them with regular expressions. Graph linear notations are a set of strings to represent labeled general graphs. They are extended with regular expressions to represent sets of graphs by specifying chosen parts for selections and repetitions of certain induced subgraphs. Methods for the conversion between graph linear notations and labeled general graphs are shown. The NP -completeness of the membership problem for graph regular expressions is proved.

TI Inference Discrepancy Based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine
   Translation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE key curriculum learning; machine translation; inference discrep-ancy;
   self-paced learning
AB In practice, even a well-trained neural machine translation (NMT) model can still make biased inferences on the training set due to distribution shifts. For the human learning process, if we can not reproduce something correctly after learning it multiple times, we consider it to be more difficult. Likewise, a training example causing a large discrepancy between inference and reference implies higher learning difficulty for the MT model. Therefore, we propose to adopt the inference discrepancy of each training example as the difficulty criterion, and according to which rank training examples from easy to hard. In this way, a trained model can guide the curriculum learning process of an initial model identical to itself. We put forward an analogy to this training scheme as guiding the learning process of a curriculum NMT model by a pretrained vanilla model. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed training scheme and take an insight into the influence of translation direction, evaluation metrics and different curriculum schedules. Experimental results on translation benchmarks WMT14 English = German, WMT17 Chinese = English and Multitarget TED Talks Task (MTTT) English <=> German, English <=> Chinese, English <=> Russian demonstrate that our proposed method consistently improves the translation performance against the advanced Transformer baseline.

TI Improving Sliced Wasserstein Distance with Geometric Median for
   Knowledge Distillation
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DE sliced Wasserstein; geometric median; knowledge distillation
AB Currently, the most advanced knowledge distillation models use a metric learning approach based on probability distributions. However, the correlation between supervised probability distributions is typically geometric and implicit, causing inefficiency and an inability to capture structural feature representations among different tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose a knowledge distillation loss using the robust sliced Wasserstein distance with geometric median (GMSW) to estimate the differences between the teacher and student representations. Due to the intuitive geometric properties of GMSW, the student model can effectively learn to align its produced hidden states from the teacher model, thereby establishing a robust correlation among implicit features. In experiment, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both high -resource and low -resource settings.

AB Dependent Quantization (DQ) is a new quantization tool introduced in the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. While it provides better rate -distortion calculation accuracy, it also increases the computational complexity and hardware cost compared to the widely used scalar quantization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a parallel -dependent quantization hardware architecture using Verilog HDL language. The architecture preprocesses the coefficients with a scalar quantizer and a highfrequency filter, and then further segments and processes the coefficients in parallel using the Viterbi algorithm. Additionally, the weight bit width of the rate -distortion calculation is reduced to decrease the quantization cycle and computational complexity. Finally, the final quantization of the TU is determined through sequential scanning and judging of the rate -distortion cost. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the quantization cycle by an average of 56.96% compared to VVC's reference platform VTM, with a Bj & oslash;ntegaard delta bit rate (BDBR) loss of 1.03% and 1.05% under the Low -delay P and Random Access configurations, respectively. Verification on the AMD FPGA development platform demonstrates that the hardware implementation meets the quantization requirements for 1080P@60Hz video hardware encoding.

DE mask-wearing detection; YOLOv7-tiny; distribution shifting convolutions;
   loss function
AB Wearing a mask correctly is an effective method to prevent respiratory infectious diseases. Correct mask use is a reliable approach for preventing contagious respiratory infections. However, when dealing with mask -wearing in some complex settings, the detection accuracy still needs to be enhanced. The technique for mask -wearing detection based on YOLOv7-Tiny is enhanced in this research. Distribution Shifting Convolutions (DSConv) based on YOLOv7-tiny are used instead of the 3 x 3 convolution in the original model to simplify computation and increase detection precision. To decrease the loss of coordinate regression and enhance the detection performance, we adopt the loss function Intersection over Union with Minimum Points Distance (MPDIoU) instead of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) in the original model. The model is introduced with the GSConv and VoVGSCSP modules, recognizing the model's mobility. The P6 detection layer has been designed to increase detection precision for tiny targets in challenging environments and decrease missed and false positive detection rates. The robustness of the model is increased further by creating and marking a mask -wearing data set in a multi environment that uses Mixup and Mosaic technologies for data augmentation. The efficiency of the model is validated in this research using comparison and ablation experiments on the mask dataset. The results demonstrate that when compared to YOLOv7-tiny, the precision of the enhanced detection algorithm is improved by 5.4%, Recall by 1.8%, mAP@.5 by 3%, mAP@.5:.95 by 1.7%, while the FLOPs is decreased by 8.5G. Therefore, the improved detection algorithm realizes more real-time and accurate mask -wearing detection tasks.

AB In academic presentation, the structure design of presentation is critical for making the presentation logical and understandable. However, it is difficult for novice researchers to construct required academic presentation structure due to the flexibility in structure creation. To help novice researchers revise and improve their presentation structure, we propose an academic presentation structure modification support system based on structural elements of the presentation slides. In the proposed system, we build a presentation structural elements model (PSEM) that represents the essential structural elements and their relations to clarify the ideal structure of academic presentation. Based on the PSEM, we also designed two evaluation indices to evaluate the academic presentation structure. To evaluate the proposed system with real -world data, we construct a web application that generates evaluation and feedback to academic presentation slides. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

TI Simultaneous Adaptation of Acoustic and Language Models for Emotional
   Speech Recognition Using Tweet Data
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS

DT Article

   model adaptation; deep neural networks
AB Emotional speech recognition is generally considered more difficult than non -emotional speech recognition. The acoustic characteristics of emotional speech differ from those of non -emotional speech. Additionally, acoustic characteristics vary significantly depending on the type and intensity of emotions. Regarding linguistic features, emotional and colloquial expressions are also observed in their utterances. To solve these problems, we aim to improve recognition performance by adapting acoustic and language models to emotional speech. We used Japanese Twitter -based Emotional Speech (JTES) as an emotional speech corpus. This corpus consisted of tweets and had an emotional label assigned to each utterance. Corpus adaptation is possible using the utterances contained in this corpus. However, regarding the language model, the amount of adaptation data is insufficient. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptation of the language model by using online tweet data downloaded from the internet. The sentences used for adaptation were extracted from the tweet data based on certain rules. We extracted the data of 25.86 M words and used them for adaptation. In the recognition experiments, the baseline word error rate was 36.11%, whereas that with the acoustic and language model adaptation was 17.77%. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method.
